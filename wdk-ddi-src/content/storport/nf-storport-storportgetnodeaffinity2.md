## -description

 A miniport can call **StorPortGetNodeAffinity2** to get the current multi-group processor affinity of the given NUMA node.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

[in] Pointer to the miniport's device extension.

### -param NodeNumber

[in] The node number of the node to query.

### -param GroupAffinities

[out] Pointer to an array of [**GROUP_AFFINITY**](../miniport/ns-miniport-_group_affinity.md) structures that, upon success, receive a group number and the affinity mask of the identified group.

### -param GroupAffinitiesCount

[in] The number of elements in the array that **GroupAffinities** points to. If the array is too small to hold the node affinity then STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL is returned and the number of elements required is returned in **GroupAffinitiesRequired**.

### -param GroupAffinitiesCountRequired

[out] Pointer to a value that receives the number of group affinities required to represent the node affinity.

## -returns

**StorPortGetNodeAffinity2** returns STOR_STATUS_SUCCESS if the node affinity was queried successfully. Possible error return values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| STOR_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | There is an invalid parameter, such as an invalid **NodeNumber** value. |
| STOR_STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  | The supplied array is too small. |
| STOR_STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL      | An error occurred for internal reasons. |

## -remarks
