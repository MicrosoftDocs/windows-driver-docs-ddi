# StorPortMarkDeviceFailedEx function

## -description

The **StorPortMarkDeviceFailedEx** routine marks a device with failed status and provides data that might be needed for diagnosis.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

Pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).

### -param StorAddress

Storage unit device address. This parameter is NULL for adapter devices.

### -param Flags

Indicates the behavior being requested by the miniport. *Flags* can be set to one of the following values.

| Flag | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_REMOVE_DEVICE | Remove the failed device. |
| STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_PREDICTED_FAILURE | Indicates that this is a predicted device failure. |

### -param FaultCode

Miniport-specific fault code.

### -param FaultDescription

Human-readable string that describes the fault.

### -param AdditionalDataSize

Size in bytes of the buffer that *AdditionalData* points to.

### -param AdditionalData

Pointer to a buffer containing additional data associated with the fault condition.

### -param CriticalDataSize

Size in bytes of the buffer that *CriticalData* points to.

### -param CriticalData

Pointer to a buffer containing critical data associated with the fault condition.

## -returns

**StorPortMarkDeviceFailedEx** returns a valid STOR_STATUS code.

## -remarks

A miniport driver can call this function to mark a failed device or to indicate that the device has potentially failed.

If no flags are set in *Flags*, Storport will only log the event.

The PnP manager will send an IRP to query the failed device's PnP state. If *Flags* is set to STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_REMOVE_DEVICE and not set to STORPORT_MARK_DEVICE_FAILED_FLAG_PREDICTED_FAILURE, the PnP manager will then try to remove the failed device.
