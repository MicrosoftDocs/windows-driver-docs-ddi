## -description

**StorPortQueueWorkItem** queues a Storport work item to execute within the context of a system (kernel) worker thread.

### -param HwDeviceExtension [in]

A pointer to the hardware device extension for the host bus adapter (HBA).

### -param WorkItemCallback [in]

| STOR_STATUS_BUSY | The work item is already queued for processing. |
| STOR_STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE | The work item cannot be queued as the device is in process of removal. |
| STOR_STATUS_INVALID_IRQL | The current IRQL is greater than DISPATCH_LEVEL. |
