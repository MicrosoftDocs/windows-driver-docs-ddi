# HW_INITIALIZE callback function


## -description

The <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine initializes the miniport driver after a system reboot or power failure occurs. It is called by StorPort after <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_find_adapter">HwStorFindAdapter</a> successfully returns. <b>HwStorInitialize</b> initializes the HBA and finds all devices that are of interest to the miniport driver.

## -parameters

### -param DeviceExtension

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.

## -returns

If the initialization succeeds, <b>HwStorInitialize</b> returns <b>TRUE</b>.

## -remarks

The name <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in <i>Storport.h</i> as follows:


```
typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_INITIALIZE (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );
```

Because <b>HwStorInitialize</b> is called at DIRQL, as much of the initialization process as possible should be performed by <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>. If so, you must enable the passive initialization routine via <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportenablepassiveinitialization">StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization</a>. 

If interrupts are generated by the hardware initialization, the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_interrupt">HwStorInterrupt</a> routine will be called. In this case, the <b>HwStorInitialize</b> routine should set up any data that <b>HwStorInterrupt</b> expects (including a <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine">HwStorDpcRoutine</a>, if one is used) before it begins to initialize the hardware. 

The following responsibilities are shared between <b>HwStorInitialize</b> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine">HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine</a>:

<ul>
<li>
Initialize hardware for the HBA registers and buffers.

</li>
<li>
Initialize and allocate all <i>DeviceExtension</i> fields.

</li>
<li>
Set up and initialize all events and DPCs that are used by the miniport driver.

</li>
</ul>

#### Examples

To define an <b>HwStorInitialize</b> callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers">Code Analysis for Drivers</a>, <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier">Static Driver Verifier</a> (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a <b>HwStorInitialize</b> callback routine that is named <i>MyHwInitialize</i>, use the <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> type as shown in this code example:


```
HW_INITIALIZE MyHwInitialize;
```

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:


```
_Use_decl_annotations_
BOOLEAN 
  MyHwInitialize( _In_ PVOID DeviceExtension )
  {
      ...
  }
```

The <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the <b>HW_INITIALIZE</b> function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-by-using-function-role-types-for-storport-drivers">Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers</a>. For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see <a href="/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior?view=vs-2015">Annotating Function Behavior</a>.
