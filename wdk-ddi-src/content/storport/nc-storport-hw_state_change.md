# HW_STATE_CHANGE callback function

## -description

A miniport-provided callback that is called after a notification from [**StorPortStateChangeDetected**](nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md) is processed.

## -parameters

### -param HwDeviceExtension

[in] A pointer to the miniport driver's per-HBA storage area.

### -param Context [in, optional]

The context supplied as **HwStateChangeContext** by the miniport in the call to [**StorPortStateChangeDetected**](nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md).

### -param AddressType [in]

The type of the address in **Address**.

### -param Address [in]

A pointer to a [**STOR_ADDRESS**](../scsi/ns-scsi-_stor_address.md) structure for the entity whose state change was processed.

### -param Status [in]

The processing status for the state change notification.

## -remarks

The **HwStorStateChange** is called with the StartIo lock acquired by Storport.

This callback enables miniports to do any additional processing that is needed after hardware addition or removal. If a hardware change occurs on the HBA port or bus, the miniport can call [**StorPortStateChangeDetected**](nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md) to alert the system of the event.

If the value for **Status** is  < 0x80000000, then the notification processing was successful. Otherwise, the notification process failed.

The name **HwStorStateChange** is just a placeholder for the miniport function that is pointed to by the **HwStateChange** parameter of [**StorPortStateChangeDetected**](nf-storport-storportstatechangedetected.md). The actual prototype of this routine is defined in *Storport.h* as follows:

``` c
typedef
VOID
HW_STATE_CHANGE (
    _In_ PVOID HwDeviceExtension,
    _In_opt_ PVOID Context,
    _In_ SHORT AddressType,
    _In_ PVOID Address,
    _In_ ULONG Status
    );
```
