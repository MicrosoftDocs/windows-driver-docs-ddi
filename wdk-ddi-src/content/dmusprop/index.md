Dmusprop.h contain these programming interfaces:


## Structures

| Title   | Description   |
| ---- |:---- |
| [_SYNTHCAPS structure](ns-dmusprop-_synthcaps.md) | The SYNTHCAPS structure specifies the capabilities of a synthesizer. |
| [_SYNTHDOWNLOAD structure](ns-dmusprop-_synthdownload.md) | The SYNTHDOWNLOAD structure specifies a handle for downloaded DLS data. It also specifies whether the buffer containing the DLS data can be freed. |
| [_SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE structure](ns-dmusprop-_synthvoicepriority_instance.md) | The SYNTHVOICEPRIORITY_INSTANCE structure identifies a voice in a MIDI synthesizer by specifying the voice's channel group (set of 16 MIDI channels) and its channel number within that group. |
| [_SYNTH_BUFFER structure](ns-dmusprop-_synth_buffer.md) | The SYNTH_BUFFER structure specifies DLS data that is being downloaded to a synthesizer. |
| [_SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure](ns-dmusprop-_synth_portparams.md) | The SYNTH_PORTPARAMS structure contains the configuration parameters for a DirectMusic port, which is a DirectMusic term for a device that sends or receives music data. |
| [_SYNTH_REVERB_PARAMS structure](ns-dmusprop-_synth_reverb_params.md) | The SYNTH_REVERB_PARAMS structure contains configuration parameters. |
| [_SYNTH_STATS structure](ns-dmusprop-_synth_stats.md) | The SYNTH_STATS structure specifies synthesizer performance statistics such as the number of voices playing, CPU usage, number of notes lost, amount of free memory, and peak volume level. |
