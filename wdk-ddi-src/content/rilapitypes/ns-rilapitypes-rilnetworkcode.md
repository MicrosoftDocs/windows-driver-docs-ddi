## -struct-fields

### -field cbSize

The size of the structure in bytes.


### -field dwParams

A bitwise combination of <a href="..\rilapitypes\ne-rilapitypes-rilnetworkcodeparammask.md">RILNETWORKCODEPARAMMASK</a> enumeration values that indicates which members of the structure contain valid data. A member of the structure is valid if the corresponding bit flag is set.


### -field dwExecutor

This field is unused.


### -field dwMCC

Mobile Country Code, if applicable. For RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO it is network-dependent whether this value is available; further, the MCC provided by some 3GPP2 networks may not be accurate.


### -field dwMNC

Mobile Network Code. For RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO it is network-dependent whether this value is available; further, the MCC provided by some 3GPP2 networks may not be accurate.


### -field dwSID

System ID, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT.


### -field dwNID

Network ID, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT.


### -field dwRI

Roaming indicator, if applicable. This is available only for RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_1XRTT and RIL_SYSTEMTYPE_EVDO.
