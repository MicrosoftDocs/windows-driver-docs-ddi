# IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter method


## -description


The <code>IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter</code> method, if supported, enables a rendering plug-in to capture all output data generated by a Unidrv driver. If this method is not supported, the output data would otherwise be sent to the spooler in a call to the spooler's WritePrinter API (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).


## -parameters




### -param pdevobj

Pointer to a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547573">DEVOBJ</a> structure.


### -param pBuf

Pointer to the first byte of an array of bytes that contains the output data generated by the Unidrv driver.


### -param cbBuffer

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the array pointed to by <i>pBuf</i>.


### -param pcbWritten

Pointer to a DWORD value that receives the number of bytes of data that were successfully sent to the plug-in.


## -returns



If successful, this method returns S_OK. Otherwise, this method should return an appropriate value in the returned HRESULT.




## -remarks



At <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556211">DrvEnablePDEV</a> time, the Unidrv driver calls this method with <i>pBuf</i> and <i>pdevobj</i> set to <b>NULL</b>, and <i>cbBuf</i> set to 0, to detect whether the plug-in implements this function. The plug-in should return S_OK to indicate it implements this method, and should return E_NOTIMPL otherwise.

This method should report the number of bytes written to the spooler's <b>WritePrinter</b> function in <i>pcbWritten</i>. A value of zero carries no special meaning; errors must be reported through the returned HRESULT.

The <code>IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter</code> method is optional. If a rendering plug-in implements this method, the plug-in's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff554253">IPrintOemUni::GetImplementedMethod</a> method must return S_OK when it receives "WritePrinter" as input.
