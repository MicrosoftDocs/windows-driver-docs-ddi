# NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected macro



## -description
<b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> notifies NDIS and the client that data transfers can begin on a VC that
  the MCM driver created for an 
  <i>incoming</i> call initiated on a remote node.



## -syntax

````
VOID NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected(
  [in] NDIS_HANDLE NdisVcHandle
);
````


## -parameters

### -param NdisVcHandle [in]

Specifies the handle to the VC that represents the connection, created with 
     <a href="..\ndis\nf-ndis-ndismcmcreatevc.md">NdisMCmCreateVc</a> when the MCM driver set
     up the VC for the incoming call.


## -remarks
An MCM driver's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cm_incoming_call_complete.md">
    ProtocolCmIncomingCallComplete</a> function calls 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> to complete the final handshake for an incoming call from a remote
    node, which the local client has already accepted.

A call to 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b> causes NDIS to call the client's 
    <a href="..\ndis\nc-ndis-protocol_cl_call_connected.md">
    ProtocolClCallConnected</a> function.

Only connection-oriented miniport drivers that provide integrated call-management support can call 
    <b>NdisMCmDispatchCallConnected</b>. Stand-alone call managers, which register themselves with NDIS as
    protocol drivers, call 
    <b>NdisCmDispatchCallConnected</b> instead.
