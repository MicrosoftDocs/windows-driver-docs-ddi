# SerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransactionComplete function


## -description


The <b>SerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransactionComplete</b> method notifies version 2 of the serial framework extension (SerCx2) that the serial driver has finished initializing the serial controller hardware in preparation for a new PIO-receive transaction.


## -parameters




### -param PioReceive [in]

A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/serports/sercx2-object-handles">SERCX2PIORECEIVE</a> handle to a PIO-receive object. The serial controller driver previously called the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265264">SerCx2PioReceiveCreate</a> method to create this object.


### -param InitSuccess [in]

Whether the initialization was successful. If <b>TRUE</b>, the initialization succeeded. If <b>FALSE</b>, the initialization failed.


## -returns



None.




## -remarks



Before SerCx2 starts a PIO-receive transaction, SerCx2 calls the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/E03B5319-BBBE-4396-8D03-8BC82FB97D15">EvtSerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction</a> event callback function, if it is implemented, to initialize the serial controller hardware. In response to this call, the driver should first do any initialization that is needed; then the driver must call <b>SerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransactionComplete</b> to notify SerCx2. SerCx2 expects this notification and does not start the transaction until it is notified.

The serial controller driver must call <b>SerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransactionComplete</b> only in response to a call to the <i>EvtSerCx2PioReceiveInitializeTransaction</i> function.

For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn265332">SerCx2 PIO-Receive Transactions</a>.
