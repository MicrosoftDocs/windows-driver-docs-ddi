# D3D12DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE_0003 structure

## -description

The **D3D12DDIARG_CREATEDEVICE_0003** structure describes the display device to create.

## -struct-fields

### -field hRTDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context) that specifies the handle that the driver should use when it calls back into the Direct3D runtime.

### -field Interface [in]

The Direct3D interface version.

### -field Version [in]

A UINT value that the driver can use to identify when the Direct3D runtime was built (the runtime version).

### -field pKTCallbacks

A pointer to a [**D3DDDI_DEVICECALLBACKS**](..//d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddi_devicecallbacks.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access kernel services.

### -field hDrvDevice

 A handle to the display device (graphics context) that the Direct3D runtime uses in subsequent driver calls to identify the display device.

### -field p12UMCallbacks

 A pointer to a D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0003 structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality.

### -field p12UMCallbacks_0022

A pointer to a [D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0022](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_corelayer_devicecallbacks_0022.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality.

### -field p12UMCallbacks_0050

A pointer to a [D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0050](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_corelayer_devicecallbacks_0050.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality.

### -field p12UMCallbacks_0062

A pointer to a [D3D12DDI_CORELAYER_DEVICECALLBACKS_0062](ns-d3d12umddi-d3d12ddi_corelayer_devicecallbacks_0062.md) structure that contains a table of Direct3D runtime callback functions that the driver can use to access core user-mode runtime functionality.

### -field Flags

Flag values that identify how to create the display device.
