# PFND3D10DDI_DRAW callback


## -description


The <b>Draw</b> function draws nonindexed primitives.


## -parameters




### -param Arg1


### -param Arg2


### -param Arg3








#### - hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


#### - VertexCount [in]

 The number of vertices in the vertex buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives.


#### - StartVertexLocation [in]

 The first vertex in the vertex buffer that vertices are read from to draw the primitives.


## -returns



None

The driver can use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.




## -remarks



The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/968b04a7-8869-410c-a6fc-83d57726858f">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of <b>Draw</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
