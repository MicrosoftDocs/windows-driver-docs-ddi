## -parameters




### -param D3D10DDI_HDEVICE



### -param D3D11_1DDI_HVIDEOPROCESSOR



### -param UINT



### -param *






#### - hDevice [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).




#### - hVideoProcessor [in]

A handle to the video processor object that was created through a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d11_1ddi_createvideoprocessor.md">CreateVideoProcessor</a> function. 




#### - StreamIndex [in]

The zero-based index of the input stream.


#### - pGuid [in]

A pointer to a GUID that identifies the private state data. The meaning of this GUID is defined by the graphics driver.




#### - DataSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the private state data in the buffer referenced by the <i>pData</i> parameter.


#### - pData [in]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the private state data. 


<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The Direct3D runtime does not validate the private state data in the buffer before it calls the  <b>VideoProcessorSetStreamExtension</b> function</div><div> </div>

## -returns
