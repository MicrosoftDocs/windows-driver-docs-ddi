# PFND3D11DDI_STATE_HS_SAMPLER_CB callback



## -description
The <b>pfnStateHsSamplerCb</b> function causes the Microsoft Direct3D 11 runtime to refresh the hull shader sample state. 



## -prototype

````
PFND3D11DDI_STATE_HS_SAMPLER_CB pfnStateHsSamplerCb;

void APIENTRY pfnStateHsSamplerCb(
  _In_ D3D10DDI_HRTCORELAYER hRuntimeDevice,
  _In_ UINT                  Base,
  _In_ UINT                  Count
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hRuntimeDevice [in]

 A handle to a context for the core Direct3D runtime. This handle is supplied to the driver in a call to the driver's <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_createdevice.md">CreateDevice(D3D10)</a> function. 


### -param Base [in]

 The beginning sampler for which the runtime should refresh state. 


### -param Count [in]

 The total number of samplers. The number can be -1, which specifies that the Direct3D runtime uses its high watermarks to substitute an optimal value (which is typically less than the maximum valid value for <i>Count</i>). However, no non-NULL binding exists in a slot larger than the optimal <i>Count</i> value.


## -returns
None
