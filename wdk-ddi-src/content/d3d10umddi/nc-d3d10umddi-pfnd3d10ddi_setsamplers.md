# PFND3D10DDI_SETSAMPLERS callback



## -description
The <b>CsSetSamplers</b> function sets samplers for a compute shader.



## -prototype

````
PFND3D10DDI_SETSAMPLERS CsSetSamplers;

VOID APIENTRY CsSetSamplers(
  _In_       D3D10DDI_HDEVICE  hDevice,
  _In_       UINT              Offset,
  _In_       UINT              NumSamplers,
  _In_ const D3D10DDI_HSAMPLER *phSamplers
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters

### -param hDevice [in]

 A handle to the display device (graphics context).


### -param Offset [in]

 The offset to the first sampler to set. 


### -param NumSamplers [in]

 The total number of samplers to set. 


### -param phSamplers [in]

 An array of handles to the samplers, beginning at the offset that <i>Offset</i> specifies.


## -returns
None

The driver can use the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> callback function to set an error code. For more information about setting error codes, see the following Remarks section.


## -remarks
The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the <a href="..\d3d10umddi\nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb.md">pfnSetErrorCb</a> function, the Direct3D runtime determines that the error is critical. Even if the device is removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interferes with the operation of <b>CsSetSamplers</b> (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.
