# SPB_TRANSFER_LIST structure

## -description

The **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure describes an [I/O transfer sequence](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/i-o-transfer-sequences).

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure. This size value does not include any **Transfers** array elements that might follow this structure. If new members are added to future versions of this structure, the **Size** value can be used to determine which version of the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure is being used.

### -field Reserved

Reserved for use by the operating system. Set to zero.

### -field TransferCount

The number of elements in the **Transfers** array. This array contains a minimum of one element.

### -field Transfers

This member is the first element in an array of [SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_list_entry.md) structures. Each array element describes an individual transfer in the I/O transfer sequence. If the array contains more than one element, the additional array elements immediately follow the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure in memory. The transfers are performed in the order in which they appear in the array, starting with the first element.

## -remarks

The input buffer for an [IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls#ioctl_spb_execute_sequence) request begins with an **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure. The first transfer in the requested I/O transfer sequence is specified in the **Transfers** member of this structure. If the sequence contains more than one transfer, the array elements that describe the additional transfers immediately follow the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure.

The input buffer for an [IOCTL_SPB_FULL_DUPLEX](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls#ioctl_spb_full_duplex-control-code) request begins with an **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure. The **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure for this request always specifies two buffers. The first buffer, which is described by the **Transfers** member of this structure, contains the data to write to the device. The second buffer, which is described by an array element that immediately follows the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure, is used to hold the data read from the device.

If your SPB controller driver supports custom I/O control (IOCTL) requests that use input or output buffers, use the **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST** structure to describe these buffers. For more information, see [Using the SPB_TRANSFER_LIST Structure for Custom IOCTLs](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/using-the-spb-transfer-list-structure).
