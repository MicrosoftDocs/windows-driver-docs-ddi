# SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY structure

## -description

The **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY** structure describes a single transfer in an [I/O transfer sequence](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/i-o-transfer-sequences).

## -struct-fields

### -field Direction

The direction of the transfer. This member is set to one of the following [SPB_TRANSFER_DIRECTION](./ne-spb-spb_transfer_direction.md) enumeration values:

* **SpbTransferDirectionFromDevice**
* **SpbTransferDirectionToDevice**

### -field DelayInUs

An optional delay, in microseconds, before this transfer begins. For more information, see the description of the **DelayInUs** member in [SPB_TRANSFER_DESCRIPTOR](../spbcx/ns-spbcx-spb_transfer_descriptor.md).

### -field Buffer

The buffer for this transfer. This member uses one of the following buffer formats: simple buffer, scatter-gather list, or (for kernel-mode clients) MDL. For more information about buffer formats, see [SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_buffer.md).

## -remarks

To request an I/O transfer sequence for a target device on the bus, a client (peripheral driver) of the SPB controller driver sends an [IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls#ioctl_spb_execute_sequence) request that describes the sequence. The transfers in the sequence are described by an [SPB_TRANSFER_LIST](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_list.md) structure that is followed by an array of one or more **SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY** structures. Each element in this array describes an individual transfer in the sequence.
