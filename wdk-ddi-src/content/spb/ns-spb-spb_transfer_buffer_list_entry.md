# SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY structure

## -description

The **SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY** structure describes either a simple transfer buffer, or an element in an array of one or more transfer buffers.

## -struct-fields

### -field Buffer

The virtual address of the transfer buffer. For a transfer that is requested by a client of the SPB controller driver that runs in user mode, this buffer must reside entirely in user-mode memory.

### -field BufferCb

The size, in bytes, of the transfer buffer that *Buffer* points to.

## -remarks

To request an [I/O transfer sequence](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/i-o-transfer-sequences) for a target device on the bus, a client (peripheral driver) of the SPB controller driver sends an [IOCTL_SPB_EXECUTE_SEQUENCE](/windows-hardware/drivers/spb/spb-ioctls#ioctl_spb_execute_sequence) request that describes the sequence. The transfers in the sequence are described by an [SPB_TRANSFER_LIST](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_list.md) structure that is followed by an array of one or more [SPB_TRANSFER_LIST_ENTRY](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_list_entry.md) structures. Each element in this array describes an individual transfer in the sequence, and each element contains an [SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER](./ns-spb-spb_transfer_buffer.md) structure that describes the buffer to use for the transfer.

If the buffer format is **SpbTransferBufferFormatSimple**, an **SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER** structure contains a single **SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY** structure that describes a simple buffer that is specified by an address and a length. If the buffer format is **SpbTransferBufferFormatList**, the buffer is a scatter-gather list, and the **SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER** structure contains a pointer to an **SPB_TRANSFER_BUFFER_LIST_ENTRY** array that describes the list.
