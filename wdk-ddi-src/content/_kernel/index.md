# Kernel

## -description

Standard driver routines must be implemented by your driver. Driver support routines are routines that the Windows operating system provides. Drivers do not use Microsoft Win32 routines; instead, they use the driver support routines that this section describes.

The driver support routines in this section are organized by kernel-mode managers and libraries.

- Standard Driver Routines
  
  Here are the required and optional routines that you must implement in your driver to respond to calls from Windows or other drivers. When these routines are called, your code must respond to the call and return the appropriate data in a timely manner.

  The following routines are required for all drivers:

  - [DriverEntry](../wdm/nc-wdm-driver_initialize.md)
  - [AddDevice](../wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device.md)
  - [Dispatch___ (routines beginning with "Dispatch" such as DispatchCreate)](../wdm/nc-wdm-driver_dispatch.md)
  - [DriverUnload](../wdm/nc-wdm-driver_unload.md)

  The other routines are optional, but you may need to implement them depending on your driver type and the location of your driver in the device stack.

  For more information about standard driver routines, see [Introduction to Standard Driver Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-standard-driver-routines).

- Driver Support Routines

  Driver support routines are routines that the Windows operating system provides for kernel-mode drivers to use. Drivers do not use Microsoft Win32 routines; instead, they use the driver support routines that this section describes.

  The driver support routines in this section are organized by kernel-mode managers and libraries.

  The following kernel-mode managers provide support for drivers:

  - Object Manager Routines
  - Memory Manager Routines
  - Process and Thread Manager Routines
  - I/O Manager Routines
  - Power Manager Routines
  - Configuration Manager Routines
  - Kernel Transaction Manager Routines
  - Security Reference Monitor Routines

  The following kernel-mode libraries provide support for drivers:

  - Core Kernel Library Support Routines
  - Executive Library Support Routines
  - Run-Time Library (RTL) Routines
  - Safe String Library Routines
  - Safe Integer Library Routines
  - Direct Memory Access (DMA) Library Routines
  - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Library Routines
  - Common Log File System (CLFS) Routines
  - Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Library Support Routines
  - ZwXxx Routines
  - Auxiliary Kernel-Mode Library Routines and Structures
  - Processor Group Compatibility Library

The following routines are reserved for system use. Do not use them in your driver.

- HalAcquireDisplayOwnership
- HalAllocateAdapterChannel. Use AllocateAdapterChannel instead.
- HalAllocateCrashDumpRegisters
- HalAllocateMapRegisters
- HalGetScatterGatherList. Use GetScatterGatherList instead.
- HalMakeBeep
- HalPutDmaAdapter. Use PutDmaAdapter instead.
- HalPutScatterGatherList. Use PutScatterGatherList instead.

The following obsolete routines are exported only to support existing drivers:

| Obsolete routine | Replacement |
|---|---|
| HalAllocateCommonBuffer | See [AllocateCommonBuffer](../wdm/nc-wdm-pallocate_common_buffer.md) instead. |
| HalAssignSlotResources | Drivers of PnP devices are assigned resources by the PnP manager, which passes resource lists with each IRP_MN_START_DEVICE request. Drivers that must support a legacy device that cannot be enumerated by the PnP manager should use IoReportDetectedDevice and IoReportResourceForDetection. |
| HalFreeCommonBuffer | See [FreeCommonBuffer](../wdm/nc-wdm-pfree_common_buffer.md) instead. |
| HalGetAdapter | See [IoGetDmaAdapter](../wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter.md) instead. |
| HalGetBusData | Instead, use [IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-interface) to query the GUID_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface. This query request returns a function pointer to GetBusData, which can be used to read from the configuration space of a given device. |
| HalGetBusDataByOffset | Instead, use IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE to query the GUID_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface. This query request returns a function pointer to GetBusData, which can be used to read from the configuration space of a given device. |
| HalGetDmaAlignmentRequirement | See GetDmaAlignment instead. |
| HalGetInterruptVector | Drivers of PnP devices are assigned resources by the PnP manager, which passes resource lists with each IRP_MN_START_DEVICE request. Drivers that must support a legacy device that cannot be enumerated by the PnP manager should use IoReportDetectedDevice and IoReportResourceForDetection. |
| HalReadDmaCounter | See ReadDmaCounter instead. |
| HalSetBusData | Instead, use IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE to query the GUID_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface. This query request returns a function pointer to SetBusData, which can be used to write to the configuration space of a given device. |
| HalSetBusDataByOffset | Instead, use IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE to query the GUID_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface. This query request returns a function pointer to SetBusData, which can be used to write to the configuration space of a given device. |
| HalTranslateBusAddress | The PnP manager passes lists of raw and translated resources in its IIRP_MN_START_DEVICE request for each device. Consequently, in most cases there is no need to translate bus addresses. However, if translation is required, use IRP_MN_QUERY_INTERFACE to query the GUID_BUS_INTERFACE_STANDARD interface. The query request returns a function pointer to TranslateBusAddress, which can be used to translates addresses on the parent bus to logical addresses. |

These obsolete routines are included in the Ntddk.h header file.

The following routine is not supported and should not be used:

- HalReturnToFirmware

Windows performs resource balancing of PCI bus resources to open an address region for a plugged device. The rebalance operation causes the bus data for some driver's device to move dynamically (between IRP_MN_STOP_DEVICE and IRP_MN_START_DEVICE calls). Therefore, a driver must not access the bus data directly. Instead the driver must pass it down to the lower bus driver because it knows the location of the device.

For more information, see [Stopping a Device to Rebalance Resources](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/stopping-a-device-to-rebalance-resources).

### Registry

Used for obtaining and reporting configuration information, and for registering interfaces in the registry.

| IoCreateSynchronizationEvent | Initializes a named synchronization event to be used to serialize access to hardware between two otherwise unrelated drivers. |
| PsCreateSystemThread | Creates a kernel-mode thread that is associated with a given process object or with the default system process. Returns a handle for the thread. |
| PsTerminateSystemThread | Terminates the current thread and satisfies as many waits as possible for the current thread object. |

| ExReinitializeResourceLite | Reinitializes an existing resource variable. |
| ExDeleteResourceLite | Deletes a caller-initialized resource from the system's resource list. |
| ObReferenceObjectByHandle | Returns a pointer to the object body and handle information (attributes and granted access rights), given the handle for an object, the object's type, and a mask. Specifies the desired access to the object and the preferred access mode. A successful call increments the reference count for the object. |
| ObReferenceObjectByPointer | Increments the reference count for an object so the caller can ensure that the object is not removed from the system while the caller is using it. |

## I/O manager routines

All kernel-mode drivers except video and SCSI miniport drivers and NDIS drivers call IoXxx routines.

References for the IoXxx routines are in alphabetical order.

For an overview of the functionality of these routines, see Summary of Kernel-Mode Support Routines.

The following routine is for system use. Do not use it in your driver.

- IoUpdateDiskGeometry

## Power management routines

The Windows power management architecture provides a comprehensive approach to power management supported at the component (subdevice) level, in addition to the system level and the device level.

Kernel-mode drivers call the PoXxx routines to perform power management for the devices that they control. This section contains the reference pages for these routines. The PoXxx routines are declared in the Wdm.h header file.

For more information about power management, see [Power Management for Windows Drivers](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/implementing-power-management).

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| PoCallDriver | The PoCallDriver routine passes a power IRP to the next-lower driver in the device stack. (Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000 only.) |

### Device power management

Starting with Windows 8, drivers can divide their device hardware into multiple logical components to enable fine-grained power management. A component has a set of power states that can be managed independently of the power states of other components in the same device. In the F0 state, the component is fully turned on. The component might support additional, low-power states F1, F2, and so on.

The power policy owner for a device is typically the device's function driver. To enable component-level power management, this driver registers the device with the power management framework (PoFx). By registering the device, the driver assumes the responsibility for informing PoFx when a component is actively being used and when the component is idle. PoFx makes intelligent idle state choices for the device based on information about the component activity, latency tolerance, expected idle durations, and wake requirements. By controlling power usage at the component level, PoFx can reduce power requirements while preserving system responsiveness. For more information, see Component-Level Power Management.

This section describes the routines that are implemented by the power management framework (PoFx) to enable device power management. These routines are called by the driver that is the power policy owner (PPO) for a device. Typically, the function driver for a device is the PPO for this device.

### Device power management callbacks

Device power management callbacks are the callback routines that are required by the power management framework (PoFx) to enable device power management. The driver that is the power policy owner for the device implements these callback routines. PoFx calls these routines to query and configure the power states of the components in the device.

## IRPs

Microsoft Windows use I/O Request Packets (IRPs) to send messages to device drivers. An IRP is a data structure that contains specific information used to convey the status of an event. For more information about the IRP data structure, see IRP and [IRP Major Function Codes](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-major-function-codes).

Your driver can use System-Supplied Driver Interfaces to send IRPs to other drivers.

In addition to the Standard IRP Codes, there are three additional types of IRPs for specific technologies:

- Plug and Play IRPs, see [Plug and Play Minor IRPs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/plug-and-play-minor-irps)

- Power Management IRPs, see [Power Management Minor IRPs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/power-management-minor-irps)

- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) IRPs, see [WMI Minor IRPs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/wmi-minor-irps)

This section describes kernel-mode support routines that drivers can call:

- While processing IRPs.

- To allocate and set up IRPs for requests from higher-level drivers to lower drivers.

- To use file objects.

### Processing IRPs

| IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext | Copies the IRP stack parameters from the current stack location to the stack location of the next-lower driver and allows the current driver to set an I/O completion routine. |
| IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation | Copies the IRP stack parameters from the current stack location to the stack location of the next-lower driver and does not allow the current driver to set an I/O completion routine. |
| IoGetRelatedDeviceObject | Returns a pointer to the device object represented by a given file object. |
| IoGetFunctionCodeFromCtlCode | Returns the value of the function field within a given IOCTL_XXX or FSCTL_XXX code. |

| IoSetCompletionRoutine | Registers a driver-supplied IoCompletion routine for an IRP, so the IoCompletion routine is called when the next-lower-level driver has completed the requested operation in one or more of the following ways: successfully, with an error, or by canceling the IRP. |
| IoSetCompletionRoutineEx | Same as IoSetCompletionRoutine, except that it guarantees a non-Plug and Play driver is not unloaded before the IoCompletion routine exits. |
| IoCallDriver | Sends an IRP to a lower-level driver. |

| IoSetStartIoAttributes | Sets attributes for when the driver's StartIo routine will execute. |
| IoAcquireCancelSpinLock | Synchronizes cancelable state transitions for IRPs in a multiprocessor-safe manner. |
| IoSetCancelRoutine | Sets or clears the Cancel routine in an IRP. Setting a Cancel routine makes an IRP cancelable. |
| IoReleaseCancelSpinLock | Releases the cancel spin lock when the driver has changed the cancelable state of an IRP or releases the cancel spin lock from the driver's Cancel routine. |
| IoCancelIrp | Marks an IRP as canceled. |

If the result is TRUE, a removable-media driver must call IoSetHardErrorOrVerifyDevice before completing the IRP. |
| IoSetHardErrorOrVerifyDevice | Supplies the device object for which the given IRP was failed due to a user-induced error, such as supplying the incorrect media for the requested operation or changing the media before the requested operation was completed.

### Driver-allocated IRPs

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| oBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest | Allocates and sets up an IRP that specifies a major function code (IRP_MJ_PNP, IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE, IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN, or IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS) with a pointer to: The lower driver's device object on which the I/O should occur. A buffer that will contain the data to be read or that contains the data to be written. The length of the buffer in bytes. The starting offset on the media. The I/O status block where the called driver can return status information and the caller's IoCompletion routine can access it.  Returns a pointer to the IRP so the caller can set any necessary minor function code and set up its IoCompletion routine before sending the IRP to the target driver. |
| IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest | Allocates and sets up an IRP specifying a major function code (IRP_MJ_PNP, IRP_MJ_READ, IRP_MJ_WRITE, IRP_MJ_SHUTDOWN, or IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS) with a pointer to: The lower driver's device object on which the I/O should occur. A buffer that will contain the data to be read or that contains the data to be written. The length of the buffer in bytes.  The starting offset on the media.  An event object to be set to the Signaled state when the requested operation completes.  The I/O status block where the called driver can return status information and the caller's IoCompletion routine can access it. Returns a pointer to the IRP so the caller can set any necessary minor function code and set up its IoCompletion routine before sending the IRP to the target driver. |

| IoSetCompletionRoutine | Registers a driver-supplied IoCompletion routine with a given IRP, so that the IoCompletion routine is called when lower-level drivers have completed the request. The IoCompletion routine lets the caller release the IRP it allocated with IoAllocateIrp or IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest; to release any other resources it allocated to set up an IRP for lower drivers; and to perform any I/O completion processing necessary. |
| IoSetCompletionRoutineEx | Same as IoSetCompletionRoutine, except that it guarantees a non-Plug and Play driver is not unloaded before the IoCompletion routine exits. |

| IoReportDetectedDevice | Reports a non-PnP device to the PnP manager. |
| IoReportResourceForDetection | Claims hardware resources in the configuration registry for a legacy device. This routine is for drivers that detect legacy hardware that cannot be enumerated by PnP. |

| IoRequestDeviceEject | Notifies the PnP manager that the device eject button was pressed. Note that this routine reports a request for a device eject, not media eject. |

## Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) routines

This section summarizes kernel-mode support routines that drivers can use to interact with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

The categories of support routines include those that drivers can call to:

### Process IRPs that a driver receives (WMI IRP processing routines)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| WmiCompleteRequest | If a driver uses WmiSystemControl to dispatch the WMI IRP to a callback routine, then the callback routine can use WmiCompleteRequest to complete the IRP. |
| WmiSystemControl | Dispatches a WMI IRP to a driver-supplied callback routine. |
| WmiFireEvent | The WmiFireEvent routine sends an event to WMI for delivery to data consumers that have requested notification of the event. |
| WmiQueryTraceInformation | The WmiQueryTraceInformation routine returns information about a WMI event trace. |
| WmiSystemControl | The WmiSystemControl routine is a dispatch routine for drivers that use WMI library support routines to handle WMI IRPs. |
| WmiTraceMessage | The WmiTraceMessage routine adds a message to the output log of a WPP software tracing session. |
| WmiTraceMessageVa | The WmiTraceMessageVa routine adds a message to the output log of a WPP software tracing session. |

### Drivers can use these routines in processing WMI IRPs

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| WmiCompleteRequest | If a driver uses WmiSystemControl to dispatch the WMI IRP to a callback routine, then the callback routine can use WmiCompleteRequest to complete the IRP. |
| WmiSystemControl | Dispatches a WMI IRP to a driver-supplied callback routine. |

### Drivers use these routines to send WMI IRPs

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| IoWMIAllocateInstanceIds | Allocates unused WMI instance IDs for a given WMI class GUID. |
| IoWMIDeviceObjectToInstanceName | Given a device object, determines the WMI class instance name supported by the corresponding driver. Callers can use this to determine the instance names supported by a particular driver. |
| IoWMIExecuteMethod | Executes the specified WMI class method. |
| IoWMIHandleToInstanceName | Given a file handle, determines the WMI class instance name supported by the corresponding driver. Callers can use this to determine the instance names supported by a particular driver. |
| IoWMIOpenBlock | Opens a WMI data block. Callers use this to submit WMI I/O requests. |
| IoWMIQueryAllData | Fetches the property values for every instance of the specified WMI class GUID. |
| IoWMIQueryAllDataMultiple | Fetches the property values for every instance of the specified set of WMI class GUIDs. |

This section describes required and optional routines that a kernel-mode WDM driver contains, if the driver handles WMI Minor IRPs by calling WmiSystemControl. For more information, see [Calling WmiSystemControl to Handle WMI IRPs](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/calling-wmisystemcontrol-to-handle-wmi-irps).

The DpWmiXxx names that are used in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation are placeholders. A driver's DpWmiXxx routines can have any names that the driver writer chooses.

## ZwXxx / NtXxx routines

The ZwXxx routines provide a set of system entry points that parallel some of the executive's system services. Calling a ZwXxx routine from kernel-mode code results in a call to the corresponding system service. Calling a ZwXxx routine from user mode is not supported; instead, native applications (applications that bypass the Microsoft Win32 subsystem) should call the NtXxx equivalent of the ZwXxx routine.

For a list of NtXxx routines, see [NtXxx Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntxxx-routines).

For a call to a ZwXxx routine from a kernel-mode driver, the system does not check the caller's access rights, nor does it set the previous processor mode to UserMode. Before calling a ZwXxx routine, a kernel-mode driver must check all user-supplied parameters for validity.

For more information about the relationship between NtXxx and ZwXxx routines, see [Using Nt and Zw Versions of the Native System Services Routines](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-nt-and-zw-versions-of-the-native-system-services-routines). For a list of the ZwXxx routines in each major functional category, see Summary of Kernel-Mode Support Routines.

The following routines are reserved for system use. Do not use them in your driver.

## Auxiliary kernel-mode library routines and structures

The Auxiliary Kernel-Mode Library enables drivers to access some system capabilities that are not available from kernel-mode subsystems.

The AuxKlibInitialize routine initializes the Auxiliary Kernel-Mode Library. Drivers that use this library must call AuxKlibInitialize before calling any of the library's other routines.

- AuxKlibEnumerateSystemFirmwareTables
- AuxKlibGetBugCheckData
- AuxKlibGetImageExportDirectory
- AuxKlibGetSystemFirmwareTable
- AuxKlibInitialize
- AuxKlibQueryModuleInformation
- AUX_MODULE_BASIC_INFO
- AUX_MODULE_EXTENDED_INFO
- KBUGCHECK_DATA

## Processor group compatibility library

Support is available for kernel-mode drivers that use processor groups. The Processor Group (ProcGrp) compatibility library enables a kernel-mode driver that is written to use processor groups run on earlier versions of Windows, which do not support processor groups. When this driver runs on, it can take advantage of multiple processor groups, if the hardware platform supports them. When this same driver runs on an earlier version of Windows, it is limited to a single processor group, regardless of the capabilities of the hardware platform. To use the ProcGrp library, the driver must call a library initialization routine. Additionally, the driver must be compiled for the Windows 7 environment in the WDK, and must be linked with Procgrp.lib.

The ProcGrp library is designed to meet the compatibility requirements of drivers that call the following KeXxx routines but must also run on versions of Windows that do not implement these routines:

- KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx
- KeGetProcessorIndexFromNumber
- KeGetProcessorNumberFromIndex
- KeQueryActiveGroupCount
- KeQueryActiveProcessorCountEx
- KeQueryGroupAffinity
- KeQueryMaximumProcessorCount
- KeQueryMaximumProcessorCountEx
- KeQueryMaximumGroupCount
- KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx
- KeSetSystemGroupAffinityThread
- KeRevertToUserAffinityThreadEx
- KeRevertToUserGroupAffinityThread
- KeSetTargetProcessorDpcEx

The ProcGrp library implements wrapper functions for the KeXxx routines in the preceding list. If the library runs on Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, the wrapper functions simply call the corresponding KeXxx routines. The wrapper functions have the same names as these KeXxx routines, and their behavior is identical to that of the KeXxx routines that they replace.

Earlier versions of Windows do not support processor groups and do not implement the KeXxx routines in the preceding list. If the ProcGrp library is linked to a driver that runs on one of these earlier versions of Windows, the library initialization function, WdmlibProcgrpInitialize, detects that the operating system does not support processor groups. To deal with this case, each wrapper function contains a simplified implementation of the corresponding KeXxx routine. This implementation supports only one processor group, group number 0. For example, the wrapper function for the KeQueryMaximumGroupCount routine always returns a count of one. For another example, the wrapper function for the KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx routine emulates this routine by calling the KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber routine. KeGetCurrentProcessorNumber is similar to KeGetCurrentProcessorNumberEx, but lacks support for processor groups, which, in this case, has the same effect as supporting just one processor group.

For more information about the support for processor groups in Windows 7, see the [Supporting Systems That Have More Than 64 Processors white paper](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/d/f/adf1347d-08dc-41a4-9084-623b1194d4b2/MoreThan64proc.docx) on the WHDC website.

The ProcGrp library is contained in the Windows 7 version of the WDK. The library functions are declared in the Procgrp.h header file and are implemented in the Procgrp.lib library file.

In addition to the KeXxx wrapper functions, the ProcGrp library implements the following function to initialize the library:

- WdmlibProcgrpInitialize

## DMA library routines

Drivers use the routines documented in this section to perform direct memory access (DMA) operations. The routines are accessed through pointers and cannot be called directly by name.

Drivers performing DMA operations use IoGetDmaAdapter to get a pointer to the DMA_ADAPTER structure for the device. The DmaOperations member of the structure points to a DMA_OPERATIONS structure, which is a table of pointers to the DMA routines for the physical device object of that device.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| IoGetDmaAdapter | Returns a pointer to an adapter object that represents either the DMA channel to which the driver's device is connected or the driver's bus-master adapter. Also returns the maximum number of map registers the driver can specify for each DMA transfer. |
| MmGetMdlVirtualAddress | Returns the base virtual address of a buffer described by a given MDL. The returned address, used as an index to a physical address entry in the MDL, can be input to MapTransfer. |
| MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe | Returns a nonpaged system-space virtual address for the base of the memory area described by an MDL. It maps the physical pages described by the MDL into system space, if they are not already mapped to system space. |
| ADDRESS_AND_SIZE_TO_SPAN_PAGES | Returns the number of pages spanned by the virtual range defined by a virtual address and a length in bytes. A driver can use this macro to determine whether a transfer request must be split into partial transfers. |
| AllocateAdapterChannel | Reserves exclusive access to a DMA channel and map registers for a device. When the channel and registers are available, this routine calls a driver-supplied AdapterControl routine to carry out an I/O operation through either the system DMA controller or a bus-master adapter. |
| AllocateCommonBuffer | Allocates and maps a logically contiguous region of memory that is simultaneously accessible from both the processor and a device. This routine returns TRUE if the requested length was allocated. |
| BuildMdlFromScatterGatherList | Builds an MDL corresponding to a scatter/gather list. |
| BuildScatterGatherList | Prepares the system for scatter/gather DMA for a device and calls a driver-supplied routine to carry out the I/O operation. This function provides the same functionality as GetScatterGatherList, except it uses a driver-supplied buffer to hold the scatter/gather list. |
| CalculateScatterGatherList | Computes the buffer size needed to hold a scatter/gather list for a memory buffer. |
| FlushAdapterBuffers | Forces any data remaining in either a bus-master adapter's or the system DMA controller's internal buffers to be written into memory or to the device. |
| FreeAdapterChannel | Releases an adapter object that represents a system DMA channel, and optionally releases any allocated map registers. |
| FreeCommonBuffer | Releases and unmaps a previously allocated common buffer. Arguments must match those passed in an earlier call to AllocateCommonBuffer. |
| FreeMapRegisters | Releases a set of map registers that were saved from a call to AllocateAdapterChannel. A driver calls this routine after using the registers in one or more calls to MapTransfer, flushing the cache by calling FlushAdapterBuffers, and completing the bus-master DMA transfer. |
| GetDmaAlignment | Returns the buffer alignment requirements for a DMA controller or device. |
| GetScatterGatherList | Prepares the system for scatter/gather DMA for a device and calls a driver-supplied routine to carry out the I/O operation. For devices that support scatter/gather DMA, this routine combines the functionality of AllocateAdapterChannel and MapTransfer. |
| KeFlushIoBuffers | Flushes the memory region described by an MDL from all processors' caches into memory. |
| MapTransfer | Sets up map registers for an adapter object previously allocated by AllocateAdapterChannel to map a transfer from a locked-down buffer. Returns the logical address of the mapped region and, for bus-master devices that support scatter/gather, the number of bytes mapped. |
| PutDmaAdapter | Frees an adapter object previously allocated by IoGetDmaAdapter. |
| PutScatterGatherList | Frees map registers and scatter/gather list previously allocated by GetScatterGatherList. |
| ReadDmaCounter | Returns the number of bytes yet to be transferred during the current system DMA operation (in auto-initialize mode). |

## PIO

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| MmProbeAndLockPages | Probes the pages specified in an MDL for a particular kind of access, makes the pages resident, and locks them in memory; returns the MDL updated with corresponding physical addresses. |
| MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe | Returns a system-space virtual address that maps the physical pages described by a given MDL for drivers whose devices must use PIO. If no virtual address exists, one is assigned. |
| KeFlushIoBuffers | Flushes the memory region described by a given MDL from all processors' caches into memory. |
| MmUnlockPages | Unlocks the previously probed and locked pages specified in an MDL. |
| MmMapIoSpace | Maps a physical address range to a cached or non-cached virtual address range in nonpaged system space. |
| MmUnmapIoSpace | Unmaps a virtual address range from a physical address range. |

## Interrupts

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| IoConnectInterrupt | Registers a driver's interrupt handling routine. Drivers should use IoConnectInterruptEx instead. |
| IoDisconnectInterrupt | Unregisters an interrupt handling routine that IoConnectInterrupt registered. |
| IoConnectInterruptEx | Registers a driver's interrupt handling routine. Drivers can register either an InterruptService routine for line-based interrupts or an InterruptMessageService routine for message-signaled interrupts. |
| IoDisconnectInterruptEx | Unregisters an interrupt-handling routine that IoConnectInterruptEx registered. |
| IoInitializeDpcRequest | Associates a driver-supplied DpcForIsr routine with a given device object, so that the DpcForIsr routine can complete interrupt-driven I/O operations. |
| KeSynchronizeExecution | Synchronizes the execution of a driver-supplied SynchCritSection routine with that of the ISR associated with a set of interrupt objects, given a pointer to the interrupt objects. |
| KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock | Acquires the spin lock that synchronizes access with an interrupt's ISR. |

### Best practices for implementing process and thread-related callback functions

This set of guidelines applies to these callback routines:

- PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE
- PCREATE_PROCESS_NOTIFY_ROUTINE_EX
- PCREATE_THREAD_NOTIFY_ROUTINE
- PLOAD_IMAGE_NOTIFY_ROUTINE

Keep notify routines short and simple.

- Do not make calls into a user mode service to validate the process, thread, or image.

- Do not make registry calls.

- Do not make blocking and/or Interprocess Communication (IPC) function calls.

- Do not synchronize with other threads because it can lead to re-entrancy deadlocks.

- Use System Worker Threads to queue work especially work involving:

  - Slow API's or API's that call into other process.

  - Any blocking behavior which could interrupt threads in core services.

- Be considerate of best practices for kernel mode stack usage. For examples, see How do I keep my driver from running out of kernel-mode stack? and Key Driver Concepts and Tips.

### Safe string functions for Unicode and ANSI characters

Use the functions in this section to manipulate Unicode and ANSI strings in kernel-mode drivers.

Each function is available in two versions:

- A W-suffixed version that supports two-byte Unicode characters.

- An A-suffixed version that supports one-byte ANSI characters.

If you use the safe string functions instead of the string manipulation functions that are provided by C-language run-time libraries, you protect your code from buffer overrun errors that can make code untrustworthy. For more information, see [Using Safe String Functions](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-safe-string-functions).

## Safe integer library routines

This section describes the safe integer functions for drivers. These functions are defined as inline functions in the Ntintsafe.h header file in the WDK. The safe integer functions are designed to help drivers to avoid arithmetic overflow errors. These functions are divided into two sets; the first converts integer values from one type to another, and the second performs math functions. For more information about these functions, see Using Safe Integer Functions.

The Intsafe.h header file in the Windows SDK defines a similar set of safe integer functions for use by applications. For more information about this version of the safe integer functions, see [Intsafe.h Functions](/windows/win32/api/intsafe/).

## Access to driver-managed objects

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| ExCreateCallback | Creates or opens a callback object. |
| ExNotifyCallback | Calls the callback routines registered with a previously created or opened callback object. |
| ExRegisterCallback | Registers a callback routine with a previously created or opened callback object, so that the caller can be notified when conditions defined for the callback routine occur. |
| ExUnregisterCallback | Cancels the registration of a callback routine with a callback object. |
| IoRegisterDeviceInterface | Registers device functionality (a device interface) that a driver can enable for use by applications or other system components. |
| IoSetDeviceInterfaceState | Enables or disables a previously registered device interface. Applications and other system components can open only interfaces that are enabled. |
| IoGetDeviceInterfaceAlias | Returns the alias device interface of the specified interface class, if the alias exists. Device interfaces are considered aliases if they are exposed by the same underlying device and have identical interface reference strings, but are of different interface classes. |
| IoGetDeviceInterfaces | Returns a list of device interfaces of a particular device interface class (such as all devices on the system that support a HID interface). |
| IoGetFileObjectGenericMapping | Returns information about the mapping between generic access rights and specific access rights for file objects. |
| IoSetShareAccess | Sets the access allowed to a given file object representing a device. (Only highest-level drivers can call this routine.) |
| IoCheckShareAccess | Checks whether a request to open a file object specifies a desired access that is compatible with the current shared access permissions for the open file object. (Only highest-level drivers can call this routine.) |
| IoUpdateShareAccess | Modifies the current shared access permissions on the given file object. (Only highest-level drivers can call this routine.) |
| IoRemoveShareAccess | Restores the shared access permissions on the given file object that were modified by a preceding call to IoUpdateShareAccess. |
| RtlLengthSecurityDescriptor | Returns the size in bytes of a given security descriptor. |
| RtlValidSecurityDescriptor | Returns whether a given security descriptor is valid. |
| RtlCreateSecurityDescriptor | Initializes a new security descriptor to an absolute format with default values (in effect, with no security constraints). |
| RtlSetDaclSecurityDescriptor | Sets the discretionary ACL information for a given security descriptor in absolute format. |
| SeAssignSecurity | Builds a security descriptor for a new object, given the security descriptor of its parent directory (if any) and an originally requested security for the object. |
| SeDeassignSecurity | Deallocates the memory associated with a security descriptor that was created with SeAssignSecurity. |
| SeValidSecurityDescriptor | Returns whether a given security descriptor is structurally valid. |
| SeAccessCheck | Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the requested access rights can be granted to an object protected by a security descriptor and, possibly, a current owner. |
| SeSinglePrivilegeCheck | Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the current thread has at least the given privilege level. |

## Error handling

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| IoAllocateErrorLogEntry | Allocates and initializes an error log packet; returns a pointer so the caller can supply error log data and call IoWriteErrorLogEntry with the packet. |
| IoFreeErrorLogEntry | Frees an error log entry allocated by IoAllocateErrorLogEntry. |
| IoWriteErrorLogEntry | Queues a previously allocated error log packet, filled in by the driver, to the system error logging thread. |
| IoIsErrorUserInduced | Returns a Boolean value indicating whether an I/O request failed due to one of the following (user-correctable) conditions: STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT, STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY, STATUS_UNRECOGNIZED_MEDIA, STATUS_VERIFY_REQUIRED, STATUS_WRONG_VOLUME, STATUS_MEDIA_WRITE_PROTECTED, or STATUS_NO_MEDIA_IN_DEVICE. If the result is TRUE, a removable-media driver must call IoSetHardErrorOrVerifyDevice before completing the IRP. |
| IoSetHardErrorOrVerifyDevice | Supplies the device object for which the given IRP was failed due to a user-induced error, such as supplying the incorrect media for the requested operation or changing the media before the requested operation was completed. (A file system driver uses the associated device object to send a dialog box to the user; the user can then correct the error or retry the operation.) |
| IoSetThreadHardErrorMode | Enables or disables error reporting for the current thread using IoRaiseHardError or IoRaiseInformationalHardError. |
| IoRaiseHardError | Causes a dialog box to be sent to the user indicating that the given IRP was failed on the given device object for an optional VPB, so that the user can correct the error or retry the operation. |
| IoRaiseInformationalHardError | Causes a dialog box to be sent to the user, showing an I/O error status and optional string supplying more information. |
| ExRaiseStatus | Raises an error status so that a caller-supplied structured exception handler is called. (This routine is useful only to highest-level drivers that supply exception handlers, in particular to file systems.) |
| KeBugCheckEx | Brings down the system in a controlled manner, displaying the bug-check code and possibly more information, after the caller discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency that will corrupt the system unless it is brought down. After the system is brought down, this routine displays bug-check and possibly other information. (This routine can be called when debugging under-development drivers. Otherwise, drivers should never call this routine when they can handle an error by failing an IRP and by calling IoAllocateErrorLogEntry and IoWriteErrorLogEntry.) |
| KeBugCheck | Brings down the system in a controlled manner when the caller discovers an unrecoverable inconsistency that will corrupt the system if the caller continues to run. KeBugCheckEx is preferable. |
| KeInitializeCallbackRecord | Initializes a bug-check callback record before a device driver calls KeRegisterBugCheckCallback. |
| KeRegisterBugCheckCallback | Registers the device driver's bug-check callback routine, which is called if a system bug check occurs. Such a driver-supplied routine saves driver-determined state information, such as the contents of device registers, that would not otherwise be written into the system crash-dump file. |
| KeDeregisterBugCheckCallback | Removes a device driver's callback routine from the set of registered bug-check callback routines. |
