## -description

The **IStiDevice::Subscribe** method registers the caller to receive notifications of device events.

## -parameters

### -param lpSubsribe [in, out]

Caller-supplied pointer to an [STISUBSCRIBE](./ns-sti-_stisubscribe.md) structure containing subscription parameter values.

## -returns

If the operation succeeds, the method returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns one of the STIERR-prefixed error codes defined in *stierr.h*.

## -remarks

The **IStiDevice::Subscribe** method is typically called by applications that intercept events from devices and reroute them. The method allows these applications to be notified of [Still Image Device Events](/windows-hardware/drivers/image/still-image-device-events) so they can then dispatch control to appropriate display applications.

Based on contents supplied in the [STISUBSCRIBE](./ns-sti-_stisubscribe.md) structure, the caller can request to be notified of device events by Windows messages or by Win32 events (by means of **SetEvent** calls).

When the application receives notification of an event, it can call [IStiDevice::GetLastNotificationData](./nf-sti-istidevice-getlastnotificationdata.md) to find out which event occurred.

Before calling **IStiDevice::Subscribe**, clients of the **IStiDevice** COM interface must call [IStillImage::CreateDevice](/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff543778(v=vs.85)) to obtain an **IStiDevice** interface pointer, which provides access to a specified device.
