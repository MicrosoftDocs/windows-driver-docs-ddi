## -description

The DMA_ADAPTER_INFO structure is a container for a DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_XXX structure that describes the capabilities of a system DMA controller.

## -struct-fields

### -field Version

The version number of the **DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_***XXX* structure that follows this member. For a [DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1](./ns-wdm-_dma_adapter_info_v1.md) structure, set this member to DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_VERSION1 before calling the [GetDmaAdapterInfo](./nc-wdm-pget_dma_adapter_info.md) routine.

### -field V1

The capabilities of the bus-master DMA device or the system DMA controller. For more information, see [DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_V1](./ns-wdm-_dma_adapter_info_v1.md).

### -field Crashdump

Defines the **DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_CRASHDUMP** member **Crashdump**.

## -remarks

A device driver calls the [GetDmaAdapterInfo](./nc-wdm-pget_dma_adapter_info.md) routine to obtain a **DMA_ADAPTER_INFO** structure that describes the capabilities of a DMA controller.

The unnamed union in this structure contains a **DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_***XXX* structure. The **Version** member indicates which version of the **DMA_ADAPTER_INFO_***XXX* structure is contained in the union. Currently, only version 1 is supported.
