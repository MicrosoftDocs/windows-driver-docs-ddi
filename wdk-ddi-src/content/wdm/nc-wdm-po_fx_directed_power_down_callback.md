# PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_DOWN_CALLBACK callback function


## -description

Implemented by the client driver to handle driver-specific power down activities on behalf of DFx (Directed [PoFx](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/overview-of-the-power-management-framework)).

## -parameters

### -param Context: 

Supplies a pointer to the context passed in to [**PoFxRegisterDevice**](./nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice.md).

### -param Flags: 

Reserved for future use.

## -prototype

```
//Declaration

PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_DOWN_CALLBACK PoFxDirectedPowerDownCallback; 

// Definition

VOID PoFxDirectedPowerDownCallback 
(
	PVOID Context
	ULONG Flags
)
{...}

```

## -remarks

WDM drivers that register with PoFx for runtime idle power management support need to implement this callback to add DFx support.

Register your implementation of this callback function by setting the appropriate member of the [**PO_FX_DEVICE_V3**](ns-wdm-po_fx_device_v3.md) structure and then calling [**PoFxRegisterDevice**](./nf-wdm-pofxregisterdevice.md).

This callback is invoked when the system enters DRIPS, not Modern Standby. In other words, this callback is invoked after a DRIPS constraint device has been active for at least two consecutive minutes (driver-configurable timeout, default 2 minutes) when the system is in Modern Standby and there is no activator-brokered software activity running.

When this callback is invoked, the driver typically performs the following high-level tasks:

- Stop processing new work.
- Transition into low-power state immediately.
- Remain in low-power state until the system calls the driver's [PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_UP_CALLBACK](./nc-wdm-po_fx_directed_power_up_callback.md).

Implementation steps and order may vary, but might include some of the following:

- Request a Dx IRP.
- After the Dx IRP arrives, block I/O queues.
- Wait for in-progress operations to complete.
- If those operations are taking too long, optionally cancel them.
- Perform actions necessary to transition the device into Dx (for example save hardware state).
- Arm for wake as necessary.
- Call [**PoFxCompleteDirectedPowerDown**](./nf-wdm-pofxcompletedirectedpowerdown.md).
- Remain in Dx until the system calls [PO_FX_DIRECTED_POWER_UP_CALLBACK](./nc-wdm-po_fx_directed_power_up_callback.md).

The contract is very similar to S3/S4, although no S-IRPs are involved.

Note that if a device hierarchy is involved, the directed power framework asks the child devices to power down before the parent device.  For a given parent device, direct children (ones enumerated by the parent) and indirect children due to [power relations](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-query-device-relations) are considered.
