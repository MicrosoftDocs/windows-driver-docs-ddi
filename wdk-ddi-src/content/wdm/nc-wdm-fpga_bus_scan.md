# FPGA_BUS_SCAN callback function

## -description
Reserved for future use.

Triggers a bus scan at the parent of the FPGA device.

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

FPGA_BUS_SCAN FpgaBusScan; 

// Definition

VOID FpgaBusScan 
(
	PVOID Context
)
{...}

FPGA_BUS_SCAN *PFPGA_BUS_SCAN


```

## -parameters

### -param Context
[_In_reads_opt_(_Inexpressible_("varies"))] The handle to the bus extension.


## -returns


## -remarks

A device driver that successfully queries for the GUID_PCI_FPGA_CONTROL_INTERFACE interface receives a pointer to a [**FPGA_CONTROL_INTERFACE**](ns-wdm-_fpga_control_interface.md) structure in which the driver sets the **BusScan** member to a pointer to its implementation of the _FPGA_BUS_SCAN_ callback function.
