# PCW_COUNTER_DESCRIPTOR structure

## -description

The `PCW_COUNTER_DESCRIPTOR` structure is used to provide information about a counter value during counterset registration. Most developers do not need to access this structure directly because it is automatically managed by the counterset registration code generated by the [CTRPP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/perfctrs/ctrpp) tool.

## -struct-fields

### -field Id

A numeric value that specifies the ID of the counter described by this structure. This should match the value provided in the `id` field of a [counter](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/perfctrs/performance-counters-counter-complex-type) element in the provider's counterset manifest.

### -field StructIndex

A numeric value that specifies an index into an array of [PCW_DATA](ns-wdm-_pcw_data.md) structures. In subsequent calls to `PcwCreateInstance` or `PcwAddInstance`, the data block described by `PcwData[PcwCounterDescriptor->StructIndex]` will be used as the source of data for the counter with ID `PcwCounterDescriptor->Id`.

### -field Offset

A numeric value that specifies an offset (in bytes) relative to the data block indicated by the `StructIndex` field. In subsequent calls to `PcwCreateInstance` or `PcwAddInstance`, the address `PcwData[PcwCounterDescriptor->StructIndex].Data + PcwCounterDescriptor->Offset` will be used as the start of the value for the counter with ID `PcwCounterDescriptor->Id`.

### -field Size

A numeric value that specifies the size, in bytes, of the value for the counter with ID `PcwCounterDescriptor->Id`. The `Size` field should be set to 4 (for a `UINT32` counter value) or 8 (for a `UINT64` counter value).

## -remarks

Most developers do not need to use this structure directly. The `CTRPP` tool generates registration code that initializes `PCW_COUNTER_DESCRIPTOR` structures based on the content of the provider manifest.

An array of `PCW_COUNTER_DESCRIPTOR` structures is provided during counterset registration (via the [PCW_REGISTRATION_INFORMATION](ns-wdm-_pcw_registration_information.md) structure passed to `PcwRegister`). The information from the array is recorded and will be used by `PcwCreateInstance` or `PcwAddInstance` to extract counter values from the data blocks described by a `PCW_DATA` array.
