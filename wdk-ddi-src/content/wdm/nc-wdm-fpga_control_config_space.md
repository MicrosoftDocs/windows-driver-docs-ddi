# FPGA_CONTROL_CONFIG_SPACE callback function

## -description

Reserved for future use.
Enables or disables the access to the configuration space of the FPGA device. 

## -prototype

```cpp
//Declaration

FPGA_CONTROL_CONFIG_SPACE FpgaControlConfigSpace; 

// Definition

NTSTATUS FpgaControlConfigSpace 
(
	PVOID Context
	BOOLEAN Enable
)
{...}

FPGA_CONTROL_CONFIG_SPACE *PFPGA_CONTROL_CONFIG_SPACE


```

## -parameters

### -param Context
[_In_reads_opt_(_Inexpressible_("varies"))] The handle to the bus extension.

### -param Enable
[_In_] A boolean value that indicates whether the configuration space access should be enabled or disabled. TRUE indicates enabled; FALSE otherwise.


## -returns

Return STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, return an appropriate NTSTATUS Values error code. For more information, see [NTSTATUS Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values).

## -remarks

A device driver that successfully queries for the GUID_PCI_FPGA_CONTROL_INTERFACE interface receives a pointer to a [**FPGA_CONTROL_INTERFACE**](ns-wdm-_fpga_control_interface.md) structure in which the driver sets the **ControlConfigSpace** member to a pointer to its implementation of the _FPGA_CONTROL_CONFIG_SPACE_ callback function.

-    This callback function toggles the configuration space access to all the functions of the FPGA device.

-    When the configuration space is locked down, all read accesses return FF and all write accesses are discarded.

-    Until the configuration space is unlocked, the FPGA device is not reported to PNP as missing even when reading its configuration space returns FF.

-    If there exists any active bus scan, it is not safe to lock down configuration space as it might confuse the scan bus.
