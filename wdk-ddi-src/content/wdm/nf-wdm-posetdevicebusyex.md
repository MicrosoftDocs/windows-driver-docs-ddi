# PoSetDeviceBusyEx function (wdm.h)


## -description

The <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> routine notifies the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/power-manager">power manager</a> that the device associated with the specified idle counter is busy.

## -parameters

### -param IdlePointer 

[in, out]
A pointer to an idle counter. This is a pointer value that was previously returned by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-poregisterdeviceforidledetection">PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</a> routine. Because <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> might return a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the caller must verify that the pointer is non-<b>NULL</b> before it calls <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b>.

## -remarks

This routine is a direct replacement for the [PoSetDeviceBusy](./nf-wdm-posetdevicebusy.md) macro. If you are writing new driver code for Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows, call <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> instead of <b>PoSetDeviceBusy</b>.

A driver calls the <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> and <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> routines to enable system idle detection for its device. If a device that is registered for idle detection stays idle for the driver-specified time-out period, the power manager sends an <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-set-power">IRP_MN_SET_POWER</a> request to put the device in a requested sleep state.

<b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> reports that the device is busy, so that the power manager can restart its idle countdown. If the device is in a sleep state, <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> does not change the state of the device. That is, it does not cause the system to send an <b>IRP_MN_SET_POWER</b> request to awaken the device.

<b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> is designed for use with I/O operations that are relatively brief compared to the time-out period of the idle counter. For longer operations that might exceed this period, use the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-postartdevicebusy">PoStartDeviceBusy</a> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-poenddevicebusy">PoEndDeviceBusy</a> routines instead.

A driver that makes multiple requests for brief I/O operations should call <b>PoSetDeviceBusyEx</b> for every I/O request that it makes.
