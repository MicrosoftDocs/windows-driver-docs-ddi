# CcZeroData function


## -description

The <b>CcZeroData</b> routine zeros the specified range of bytes in a cached or noncached file.

## -parameters

### -param FileObject 

[in]
A pointer to a file object (<a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object">FILE_OBJECT</a>) for the file in which a range of bytes is to be zeroed.

### -param StartOffset 

[in]
A pointer to a variable that specifies the byte offset within the file to the first byte that is to be zeroed.

### -param EndOffset 

[in]
A pointer to a variable that specifies the byte offset within the file to the last byte that is to be zeroed.

### -param Wait 

[in]
Set to <b>TRUE</b> if the caller should be put into a wait state until the entire byte range has been zeroed. Otherwise, this parameter is set to <b>FALSE</b>.

## -returns

<b>CcZeroData</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the data is zeroed successfully; otherwise, returns <b>FALSE</b>.

## -remarks

The file to be zeroed can be cached or noncached. However, if the file is noncached, the values of <i>StartOffset</i> and <i>EndOffset</i> must both be multiples of the volume's sector size. (For information about how to determine sector size, see the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/index">Kernel-Mode Driver Architecture Design Guide</a> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index">Kernel-Mode Driver Architecture Reference</a>.)

If a pool allocation failure occurs and <i>Wait</i> was specified as <b>TRUE</b>, <b>CcZeroData</b> raises a STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES exception. If a pool allocation failure occurs and <i>Wait</i> was specified as <b>FALSE</b>, <b>CcZeroData</b> returns <b>FALSE</b>, but does not raise an exception.

If the <i>FileObject</i> supplied does not have caching enabled, but caching exists on the stream (that is, another file object for the same file has caching enabled), then zeroing will be treated as though write-through caching is enabled.

If <i>Wait</i> is set to <b>TRUE</b>, <b>CcZeroData</b> is guaranteed to complete the zero data request and return <b>TRUE</b>. If the required pages of the cached file are already resident in memory, the data will be zeroed immediately and no blocking will occur. If any needed pages are not resident, the caller will be put in a wait state until all required pages have been made resident and the data can be zeroed.

If <i>Wait</i> is <b>FALSE</b> and if the required pages of the cached file are not already resident in memory, <b>CcZeroData</b> will refuse to block and will return <b>FALSE</b>.

If a pool allocation failure occurs, <b>CcZeroData</b> raises a STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES exception.  If <b>CcZeroData</b> encounters any other errors, including IO errors, the errors will be raised to the caller.

For Windows Vista and later Windows operating systems, the behavior of <b>CcZeroData</b> is as follows:

<ul>
<li>
If the stream is cached and write_through, <i>StartOffset</i> does not have to be sector aligned.  

</li>
<li>
If <i>EndOffset</i> is not aligned, it will be rounded up to the next sector size.  

</li>
</ul>

Under certain circumstances (which may involved the Cache Manager's copy of the ValidDataLength) this routine has to effect.  For all operations involving zeroing of previously written data File Systems should call <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-cccopywrite">CcCopyWrite</a> with appropriate parameterizatiion.
