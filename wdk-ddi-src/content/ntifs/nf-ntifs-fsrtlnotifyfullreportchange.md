## -description


The <b>FsRtlNotifyFullReportChange</b> routine completes pending notify change IRPs. 


## -parameters




### -param NotifySync [in]

A pointer to an opaque synchronization object for the current volume.


### -param NotifyList [in]

A pointer to the head of a notify list. Each element in the list is an opaque notify structure.


### -param FullTargetName [in]

A pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains the full pathname of the file.


### -param TargetNameOffset [in]

Offset within the <i>FullTargetName</i> string of the final component of the name.


### -param StreamName [in, optional]

Optional pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains a stream name to store with the file name.


### -param NormalizedParentName [in, optional]

Optional pointer to an ANSI or Unicode string that contains the same path as in the <i>FullTargetName</i> string, but with all short names replaced by the corresponding long names.


### -param FilterMatch [in]

A bitmask of flags to be compared with the completion filter in the notify structure. If any of the corresponding bits in the completion filter are set, then a notify condition exists. For possible flag values, see the <i>CompletionFilter</i> parameter of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-fsrtlnotifyfullchangedirectory">FsRtlNotifyFullChangeDirectory</a>.

### -param TargetContext [in, optional]

Context pointer to pass to the file system if performing a traverse check in the case of a tree being watched.

## -remarks



<b>FsRtlNotifyFullReportChange</b> is called by a file system when a file is modified so that pending notify change IRPs can be completed. 

<b>FsRtlNotifyFullReportChange</b> looks for a notify structure in the notify list that matches the specified filter and pathname. If a match is found, <b>FsRtlNotifyFullReportChange</b> completes all pending IRPs for the notify structure.
