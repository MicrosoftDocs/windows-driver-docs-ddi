# FsRtlBalanceReads function


## -description


The <b>FsRtlBalanceReads</b> routine signals to a fault-tolerant disk driver that it is now safe to start balancing reads from a mirrored drive. 


## -parameters




### -param TargetDevice [in]

A pointer to the device object from which the device starts the balanced read. 


## -returns



<b>FsRtlBalanceReads</b> returns STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST if the device is not a mirror. 




## -remarks



<b>FsRtlBalanceReads</b> signals to a fault-tolerant disk driver that it is safe to start balancing reads from a mirrored drive. A file system typically calls <b>FsRtlBalanceReads</b> for a newly mounted volume once it has determined that the volume is clean.
