# _FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION structure


## -description


A FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION structure used to query detailed information about the names of files in a directory. 


## -struct-fields




### -field NextEntryOffset

Byte offset for the next FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION entry, if multiple entries are present in a buffer. This member is zero if no other entries follow this one. 


### -field FileIndex

Byte offset of the file within the parent directory. This member is undefined for file systems, such as NTFS, in which the position of a file within the parent directory is not fixed and can be changed at any time to maintain sort order. 


### -field FileNameLength

Specifies the length of the file name string. 


### -field FileName

Specifies the first character of the file name string. This is followed in memory by the remainder of the string. 


## -remarks



This information can be queried in either of the following ways: 

<ul>
<li>
Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567047">ZwQueryDirectoryFile</a>, passing FileNamesInformation as the value of <i>FileInformationClass</i> and passing a caller-allocated, FILE_NAMES_INFORMATION-structured buffer as the value of <i>FileInformation</i>. 

</li>
<li>
Create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL and minor function code IRP_MN_QUERY_DIRECTORY. 

</li>
</ul>
No specific access rights are required to query this information. 

This structure must be aligned on a LONG (4-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the <b>NextEntryOffset</b> value in each entry, except the last, falls on a 4-byte boundary.
