### -param Sid [out]

A pointer to a buffer that receives the [SID](ns-ntifs-_sid.md) structure that corresponds to the **SidType** parameter. If this parameter is **NULL**, **SidBufferSize** is zero.

### -param SidBufferSize [in]

A variable that specifies the size of the **Sid** buffer in bytes.

### -param SidSize [in_out, optional]

An optional pointer to a variable that specifies the size of the **Sid** buffer. If the function fails because the buffer is too small or if **SidBufferSize** is zero, this variable receives the required buffer size. On success, this variable contains the size of the returned **Sid**.

## -returns

**SecLookupWellKnownSid** returns STATUS_SUCCESS on success or one of the following error codes on failure:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SEC_E_INTERNAL_ERROR | An internal error occurred while trying to connect to the Local System Authority (LSA) or the local procedure call (LPC) to the security provider failed. |
| STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED | The process ID associated with the currently executing thread does not match the current process ID. |
| STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL | The buffer size for the **Sid**, the *SidBufferSize* parameter, was too small. |
| STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER | A **NULL** pointer was passed for *Sid* parameter or a well-known SID could not be found for the *SidType* specified. |
| STATUS_PROCESS_IS_TERMINATING | This process has terminated so it is not possible to establish a local procedure call (LPC) connection. |

## -remarks

**SecLookupWellKnownSid** attempts to find a well known SID using a *SidType* parameter. In addition to looking up well-known SIDs on the local machine, **SecLookupWellKnownSid** can look up well-known SIDs on the local domain. **SecLookupWellKnownSid**first checks a list of well-known local SIDs. If the **SidType** does not correspond to a local well-known SID, the function checks for well-known SIDs on the primary domain.

If the function cannot find the well known SID for the *SidType* specified, **SecLookupWellKnownSid** fails. This can occur if a network time-out prevents the function from finding the SID on the primary domain. It also occurs for a **SidType** that has no corresponding well-known SID.

**SecLookupWellKnownSid** is equivalent to the Win32   **CreateWellKnownSid** function. For user-mode applications, the WELL_KNOWN_SID_TYPE enumeration is defined in *winbase.h*.

**SecLookupWellKnownSid** is exported by the ksecdd driver, which implements this function by using user-mode helper services. Accordingly, the use of this function within file systems must obey the usual rules for communication with user-mode services. **SecLookupWellKnownSid** cannot be used during paging file I/O.
