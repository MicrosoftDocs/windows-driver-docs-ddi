# PoStartDeviceBusy function (ntifs.h)


## -description

The <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> routine marks the start of a period of time in which the device is busy.

## -parameters

### -param IdlePointer 

[in, out]
A pointer to an idle counter. This is a pointer value that was previously returned by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-poregisterdeviceforidledetection">PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</a> routine. Because <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> might return a <b>NULL</b> pointer, the caller must verify that the pointer is non-<b>NULL</b> before it calls <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b>.

## -remarks

The <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-poenddevicebusy">PoEndDeviceBusy</a> routines mark the start and end of a time period in which a device is busy. Each call to <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> must be followed by a corresponding call to <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b>.

For each device, the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/power-manager">power manager</a> maintains a count of the number of outstanding <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> calls for which it has not yet received a corresponding <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> call. A <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> call increments the busy count by one. A <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> call decrements the busy count by one. A nonzero busy count disables the idle counter for the device. After the busy count reaches zero, the power manager resets the idle counter to the time-out period and enables the counter.

Rather than use the <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> routines to reset the idle counter, you can call the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-posetdevicebusyex">PoSetDeviceBusyEx</a> routine (or the [PoSetDeviceBusy](../wdm/nf-wdm-posetdevicebusy.md) macro). To disable the idle counter during an extended busy period, a driver can call the <b>PoRegisterDeviceForIdleDetection</b> routine to disable and enable idle notifications at the start and end of the busy period. However, <b>PoStartDeviceBusy</b> and <b>PoEndDeviceBusy</b> are typically more convenient to use for this purpose, and you should consider using these routines in new code that you write for Windows 7 and later versions of Windows.
