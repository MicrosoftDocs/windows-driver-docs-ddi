# FsRtlFastLock macro


## -description


The <b>FsRtlFastLock</b> macro is used by file systems and filter drivers to request a byte-range lock for a file stream. 


## -parameters




### -param A1

<p>Pointer to the FILE_LOCK structure for the file. This structure must have been initialized by a previous call to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-fsrtlallocatefilelock"><b>FsRtlAllocateFileLock</b></a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/nf-ntifs-fsrtlinitializefilelock"><b>FsRtlInitializeFileLock</b></a>.</p>


### -param A2

<p>Pointer to the file object for the open file. The file object must have been created with GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE access to the file (or both). </p>


### -param A3

<p>Pointer to a variable that specifies the starting byte offset within the file of the range to be locked.</p>


### -param A4

<p>Pointer to a variable that specifies the length in bytes of the range to be locked.</p>


### -param A5

<p>Pointer to the process ID for the process requesting the byte-range lock.</p>


### -param A6

<p>The key to be assigned to the byte-range lock.</p>


### -param A7

<p>Boolean value specifying whether the lock request should fail if the lock cannot be granted immediately. If the caller can be put into a wait state until the request is granted, set <i>FailImmediately</i> to <b>FALSE</b>. If it cannot, set <i>FailImmediately</i> to <b>TRUE</b>. </p>


### -param A8

<p>Set to <b>TRUE</b> if an exclusive lock is requested, <b>FALSE</b> if a shared lock is requested.</p>


### -param A9

<p>Pointer to a caller-allocated IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure that receives status information about the lock request. </p>


### -param A10

<p>Optional pointer to a context to use when releasing the byte-range lock. </p>


### -param A11

<p>This parameter is obsolete, but is retained for compatibility with legacy drivers.</p>






## -remarks



The <b>FsRtlFastLock</b> macro causes the caller to acquire a byte-range lock on a region of the specified file.

A return value of <b>TRUE</b> indicates that the IO_STATUS_BLOCK structure pointed to by <i>Iosb</i> received status information about the lock operation. To examine the contents of this structure, use the NT_STATUS macro.
