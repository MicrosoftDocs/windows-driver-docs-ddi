# _FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION structure

## -description

The FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION structure is used to query detailed information for the files in a directory.

## -struct-fields

### -field NextEntryOffset

Byte offset of the next FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION entry, if multiple entries are present in a buffer. This member is zero if no other entries follow this one.

### -field FileIndex

Byte offset of the file within the parent directory. This member is undefined for file systems, such as NTFS, in which the position of a file within the parent directory is not fixed and can be changed at any time to maintain sort order.

### -field CreationTime

Time when the file was created.

### -field LastAccessTime

Last time the file was accessed.

### -field LastWriteTime

Last time information was written to the file.

### -field ChangeTime

Last time the file was changed.

### -field EndOfFile

Absolute new end-of-file position as a byte offset from the start of the file. **EndOfFile** specifies the byte offset to the end of the file. Because this value is zero-based, it actually refers to the first free byte in the file. In other words, **EndOfFile** is the offset to the byte immediately following the last valid byte in the file.

### -field AllocationSize

File allocation size, in bytes. Usually, this value is a multiple of the sector or cluster size of the underlying physical device.

### -field FileAttributes

File attributes, which can be any valid combination of the following:

* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM
* FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY

### -field FileNameLength

Specifies the length of the file name string.

### -field FileName

Specifies the first character of the file name string. This is followed in memory by the remainder of the string.

## -remarks

This information can be queried in either of the following ways:

* Call <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff567047">ZwQueryDirectoryFile</a>, passing FileDirectoryInformation as the value of *FileInformationClass* and passing a caller-allocated, FILE_DIRECTORY_INFORMATION-structured buffer as the value of *FileInformation*.
* Create an IRP with major function code IRP_MJ_DIRECTORY_CONTROL and minor function code IRP_MN_QUERY_DIRECTORY.

No specific access rights are required to query this information.

All dates and times are in absolute system-time format. Absolute system time is the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the start of the year 1601.

This structure must be aligned on a LONGLONG (8-byte) boundary. If a buffer contains two or more of these structures, the **NextEntryOffset** value in each entry, except the last, falls on an 8-byte boundary.
