## -description

The GetContext method returns the context where the symbol is valid. While this will represent things such as the debug target and process/address space in which the symbol exists, it may not be as specific as a context retrieved from other means (e.g.: from an [IModelObject](nn-dbgmodel-imodelobject.md)).

## -parameters

### -param context

The host context in which the symbol is located will be returned here.

## -returns

This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

## -remarks
