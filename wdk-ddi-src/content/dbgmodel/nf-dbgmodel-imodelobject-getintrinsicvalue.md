# IModelObject::GetIntrinsicValue


## -description

The GetIntrinsicValue method returns the thing which is boxed inside an [IModelObject](nn-dbgmodel-imodelobject.md). This method may only legally be called on [IModelObject](nn-dbgmodel-imodelobject.md) interfaces which represent a boxed intrinsic or a particular interface which is boxed. It cannot be called on native objects, no value objects, synthetic objects, and reference objects. 

## -parameters

### -param intrinsicData

The value boxed inside the [IModelObject](nn-dbgmodel-imodelobject.md) is returned here. The pointer must point to a VARIANT structure which does not contain a freeable value. It is the responsibility of the caller to clear this VARIANT with VariantClear when finished with it.


## -returns
This method returns HRESULT that indicates success or failure.

## -remarks


**Code Sample**

```cpp
ComPtr<IModelObject> spObject; /* get something */

VARIANT vtVal;
HRESULT hr = spObject->GetIntrinsicValue(&vtVal);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr) && vtVal.vt == VT_I4)
{
    int iVal = vtVal.lVal; // An integer has been unboxed into iVal.
}
VariantClear(&vtVal);
```
