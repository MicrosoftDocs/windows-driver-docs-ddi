# IDataModelScriptHostContext::NotifyScriptChange


## -description

It is required that a script provider notify the debug host upon certain operations occurring with a method call to the NotifyScriptChange method on the associated context. Such operations are defined as members of the ScriptChangeKind enumeration which is defined as follows: 

Enumerant	| Description
|-------|--------|
ScriptRename	| Indicates that the name of the script has changed. This notification should be made during a Rename call on the [IDataModelScript](nn-dbgmodel-idatamodelscript.md). The host may then query back the name of the script via a GetName method. The placement of the context namespace (as returned by GetNamespaceObject) may completely change as a result of this notification.


## -parameters

### -param script
The script for which the notification is occurring.

### -param changeKind
The nature of the notification.


## -returns
This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.
