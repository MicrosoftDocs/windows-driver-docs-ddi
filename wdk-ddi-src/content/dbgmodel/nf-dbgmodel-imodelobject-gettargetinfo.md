# IModelObject::GetTargetInfo


## -description

The GetTargetInfo method is effectively a combination of the GetLocation and GetTypeInfo methods returning both the abstract location as well as native type of the given object. 

## -parameters

### -param location
The abstract location of the native object represented by the this pointer will be returned here.

### -param type
The native type of the object represented by the this pointer will be returned here as an [IDebugHostType](nn-dbgmodel-idebughosttype.md) interface.


## -returns
This method returns HRESULT that indicates success or failure.

## -remarks

**Code Sample**

```cpp
ComPtr<IModelObject> spObject; /* get an object */

Location loc;
ComPtr<IDebugHostType> spType;
if (SUCCEEDED(spObject->GetTargetInfo(&loc, &spType)))
{
    // loc has a valid location
    // spType has a valid type -- the type of the object
}
```
