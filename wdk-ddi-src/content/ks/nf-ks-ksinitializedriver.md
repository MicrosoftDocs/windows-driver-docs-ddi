## -description

The **KsInitializeDriver** function initializes the driver object of an AVStream minidriver.

## -parameters

### -param DriverObject [in]

A pointer to the [DRIVER_OBJECT](../wdm/ns-wdm-_driver_object.md) structure for the AVStream driver being initialized. Minidrivers that call **KsInitializeDriver** should use the driver object passed to **DriverEntry** by the operating system.

### -param RegistryPathName [in]

A pointer to a Unicode string containing the registry path string passed into the minidriver's **DriverEntry** function by the operating system.

### -param Descriptor [in, optional]

A pointer to a [KSDEVICE_DESCRIPTOR](./ns-ks-_ksdevice_descriptor.md) structure that specifies the characteristics of the device being initialized. If this pointer is **NULL**, a device is created with default characteristics and no associated filter factories.

## -returns

**KsInitializeDriver** returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate error code as returned by [IoCreateDevice](../wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatedevice.md) or internal AVStream device initialization routines.

## -remarks

This function is typically called from **DriverEntry**. If the minidriver passes in a device descriptor, AVStream creates a device with the specified characteristics at **AddDevice** time. Minidrivers that perform device initialization themselves do not necessarily need to call **KsInitializeDriver**.  For more information, see [Initializing an AVStream Minidriver](/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/initializing-an-avstream-minidriver).
