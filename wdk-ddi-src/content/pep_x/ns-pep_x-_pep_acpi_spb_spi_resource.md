# _PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE structure


## -description


The <b>PEP_ACPI_SPB_SPI_RESOURCE</b> structure describes an ACPI SPI serial bus resource.


## -struct-fields




### -field SpbCommon

A <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/mt186695">PEP_ACPI_SPB_RESOURCE</a> structure describing this resource.


### -field ConnectionSpeed

The maximum speed, in hertz, supported by this connection.


### -field DataBitLength

The size, in bits, of the smallest unit of transfer.


### -field Phase

The phase of the clock pulse on which to capture data.


### -field Polarity

The polarity of the clock. If zero, this indicates the
clock is low during the first phase. If 1, this indicates the
clock is high during the first phase.


### -field DeviceSelection

The device selection value. This value is
specific to the device and may refer to a chip-select line, GPIO
line, or other line selection mechanism.
