# AtaPortRegistryChannelSubkeyWriteDeferred function


## -description


The <b>AtaPortRegistryChannelSubKeyWriteDeferred</b> routine writes data asynchronously to the indicated value name under the registry key <b>HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Services\\</b><i><service name></i><b>\Controller</b><i>N</i>\\<b>Channel</b><i>M</i>, where <i>N </i>is the number of the controller and <i>M </i>is the number of the channel.
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver">Storport driver</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers">Storport miniport</a> driver models.</div><div> </div>

## -parameters




### -param ChannelExtension [in]

A pointer to the channel extension. 


### -param ControllerNumber [in]

Contains the controller number. 


### -param ValueName [in]

Contains the name of the registry value to write to. 


### -param ValueType [in]

Indicates the type of data that is contained in the registry value. This member should be assigned one of values indicated in the following table. 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_DWORD

</td>
<td>
A 4-byte numeric value. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_BINARY

</td>
<td>
Binary data. 

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
IDE_REG_SZ

</td>
<td>
A null-terminated. Unicode string. 

</td>
</tr>
</table>
 


### -param Buffer [in]

Pointer to the source buffer that contains the data to be written to the registry. 


### -param BufferLength

<p>A pointer to the number of bytes of data to copy. If the operation fails, the location that is pointed to by <i>Length</i> will update to the length of the data that was successfully written to the registry.</p>




## -returns



<b>AtaPortRegistryChannelSubKeyWriteDeferred</b> returns <b>TRUE</b> if the operation. Otherwise, it returns <b>FALSE</b>. The routine also returns <b>FALSE</b> if the miniport driver does not call it from the correct routine.




## -remarks



If the value name is not present, <b>AtaPortRegistryChannelSubKeyWriteDeferred</b> creates an entry for the value and the data is stored in the newly created value. 

The buffer that is pointed to by <i>Buffer </i>must be allocated by using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nf-irb-ataportregistryallocatebuffer">AtaPortRegistryAllocateBuffer</a>. 

The miniport driver can call <b>AtaPortRegistryChannelSubKeyWriteDeferred</b> from any of the key routines that belong to its channel interface. 

The miniport driver must not reuse the buffer that is pointed to by <i>Buffer</i> after the initial call to <b>AtaPortRegistryChannelSubKeyWriteDeferred</b>. Because the call is asynchronous, <i>Buffer</i> might still point to data that has not been flushed to the registry. The port driver flushes the data in the buffer to the registry when the miniport driver calls <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nf-irb-ataportregistryfreebuffer">AtaPortRegistryFreeBuffer</a>.
