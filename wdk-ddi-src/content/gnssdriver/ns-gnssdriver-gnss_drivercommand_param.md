## -description

The **GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_PARAM** structure is used to send a command to the GNSS driver.

The command may involve configuring certain parameters and state variables of the underlying GNSS driver or device, or executing certain defined actions through the driver.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Structure size.

### -field Version

Version number.

### -field CommandType

Identifies the specific command that the driver is required to execute.

This is a well-defined list of GNSS driver commands, as defined by the [GNSS_DRIVERCOMMAND_TYPE](./ne-gnssdriver-gnss_drivercommand_type.md) enumeration.

### -field Reserved

Reserved for future use.

### -field CommandDataSize

Size of the configuration data being sent to the driver.

### -field Unused

Padding buffer reserved for future use.

### -field CommandData

Data associated with the specific command type.

The driver must cast this buffer to the appropriate data type depending on the specific command.
