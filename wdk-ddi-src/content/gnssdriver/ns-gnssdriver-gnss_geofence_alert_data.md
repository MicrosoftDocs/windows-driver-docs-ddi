## -description

The **GNSS_GEOFENCE_ALERT_DATA** structure is used by the GNSS engine to notify a geofence breach alert.

## -struct-fields

### -field Size

Structure size.

### -field Version

Version number.

### -field GeofenceID

The ID of the geofence. This ID was generated by the GNSS engine during creation of the geofence.

### -field GeofenceState

The new state of the geofence. The alert implies transitioning to this state.

### -field FixBasicData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixAccuracyData field is expected.

### -field FixAccuracyData

The fix used to determine the geofence breach. Instead of the full set of fix data, a smaller subset contained in this field and the  FixBasicData field is expected.

### -field Unused

Padding buffer reserved for future use.
