# IOCTL_AACS_SEND_CHALLENGE_KEY IOCTL


## -description


Sends the host's challenge key to the logical unit. The host's challenge key consists of a point on an elliptic curve and its associated signature. 


## -ioctlparameters




### -input-buffer

The buffer at <b>Irp-&gt;AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer</b> contains a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550114">AACS_SEND_CHALLENGE_KEY</a> structure.


### -input-buffer-length

Length of an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff550114">AACS_SEND_CHALLENGE_KEY</a> structure.


### -output-buffer

None. 


### -output-buffer-length

None. 


### -in-out-buffer


### -inout-buffer-length


### -status-block

The <b>Information</b> field is set to the number of bytes transferred. The <b>Status</b> field is set to STATUS_SUCCESS or possibly STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES.


## -remarks



The IOCTL_AACS_SEND_CHALLENGE_KEY request corresponds to the step in the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) authentication algorithm (AACS-Auth) in which the host provides the drive a point on the curve. For a complete description of AACS-Auth, see the <i>Advanced Access Content System, Introduction and Common Cryptographic Elements</i> specification that is published by Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator (AACS LA).
