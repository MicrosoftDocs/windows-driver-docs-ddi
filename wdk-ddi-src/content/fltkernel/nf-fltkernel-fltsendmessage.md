# FltSendMessage function

## -description

**FltSendMessage** sends a message to a waiting user-mode application on behalf of a minifilter driver or a minifilter driver instance.

## -parameters

### -param Filter [in]

Opaque filter pointer for the caller. This parameter is required and cannot be **NULL**.

### -param ClientPort [in]

Pointer to a variable that contains the opaque client port pointer for the connection port between the user-mode application and the kernel-mode minifilter driver. For more information about the client port pointer, see the description of the *ConnectNotifyCallback* parameter in the reference entry for [FltCreateCommunicationPort](nf-fltkernel-fltcreatecommunicationport.md).

### -param SenderBuffer [in]

Pointer to a caller-allocated buffer containing the message to be sent to the user-mode application. This parameter is required and cannot be **NULL**.

### -param SenderBufferLength [in]

Size, in bytes, of the buffer that *SenderBuffer* points to. See **Remarks** for more information.

### -param ReplyBuffer [out, optional]

Pointer to a caller-allocated buffer that receives the reply, if any, from the application. This parameter is optional and can be **NULL**.

### -param ReplyLength [in, out]

Size, in bytes, of the buffer that *ReplyBuffer* points to. This parameter is optional, but must be non-**NULL** when *ReplyBuffer* is not **NULL**.

### -param Timeout [in, optional]

A pointer to a timeout value that specifies the total absolute or relative length of time, in units of 100 nanoseconds, for which the caller can be put into a wait state until the message is received by the user-mode application and until it receives a reply (if one is expected).

A positive value specifies an absolute time, relative to January 1, 1601. A negative value specifies an interval relative to the current time. Set to **NULL** if the caller can be put into a wait state indefinitely.

## -returns

**FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_SUCCESS or an appropriate NTSTATUS value such as one of the following:

| Return code | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES | **FltSendMessage** encountered a pool allocation failure. This is an error code. |
| STATUS_PORT_DISCONNECTED | The communication port has been disconnected. This is an error code. |
| STATUS_THREAD_IS_TERMINATING | The wait was interrupted because the thread has been terminated by an application or user. |
| STATUS_TIMEOUT | The *Timeout* interval expired before the message could be delivered or before a reply was received. This is a success code. |

## -remarks

**FltSendMessage** sends a message to a user-mode application on behalf of a minifilter driver or a minifilter driver instance.

If the application calls [FilterGetMessage](/windows/win32/api/fltuser/nf-fltuser-filtergetmessage) to get the message before the minifilter driver calls **FltSendMessage** to send it, the message is delivered immediately. This is typically the case when the application calls **FilterGetMessage** from inside a message loop.

Otherwise, if an application has not called to get a message, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state as follows:

* If *Timeout* is nonzero and the application calls **FilterGetMessage** before the *Timeout* interval expires, the message is delivered.

* If *Timeout* is nonzero and the application doesn't call **FilterGetMessage** before the *Timeout* interval expires, the message is not delivered, and **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_TIMEOUT. (Note: STATUS_TIMEOUT is a success code.)

* If *Timeout* is zero, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state indefinitely. When the application calls **FilterGetMessage**, the message is delivered.

After the message is delivered, if *ReplyBuffer* is **NULL**, **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

Otherwise, if *ReplyBuffer* is not **NULL**, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state as follows:

* If *Timeout* is nonzero and the application calls [FilterReplyMessage](/windows/win32/api/fltuser/nf-fltuser-filterreplymessage) before the *Timeout* interval expires, the minifilter driver receives the reply, and **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

* If *Timeout* is nonzero and the minifilter driver does not receive a reply before the *Timeout* interval expires, **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_TIMEOUT. (Note: STATUS_TIMEOUT is a success code.)

* If *Timeout* is zero when the minifilter driver is waiting for the reply, the minifilter driver is put into a wait state indefinitely. When the application calls **FilterReplyMessage**, the minifilter driver receives the reply, and **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_SUCCESS.

> [!NOTE]
>
>Â Due to (system-specific) structure padding requirements, accuracy is required when you set the size of buffers that are associated with **FltSendMessage** and [**FilterReplyMessage**](/windows/win32/api/fltuser/nf-fltuser-filterreplymessage). As an example, assume data must be sent via **FilterReplyMessage** to a minifilter.  The user-mode component might declare the following structure to do so:
>
> ``` C
> typedef struct _REPLY_STRUCT
> {
>     FILTER_REPLY_HEADER Header;
>     MY_STRUCT Data;  // The structure to be sent to the minifilter
> } REPLY_STRUCT, *PREPLY_STRUCT;
> ```
>
> Given this structure, it might seem obvious that the caller of [**FilterReplyMessage**](/windows/win32/api/fltuser/nf-fltuser-filterreplymessage) would set **dwReplyBufferSize** to ```sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)```, and set the **ReplyLength** parameter of **FltSendMessage** to the same value. However, because of structure padding idiosyncrasies, ```sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)``` might be larger than ```sizeof(FILTER_REPLY_HEADER) + sizeof(MY_STRUCT)```.  If this is the case, **FltSendMessage** returns STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.
>
> Therefore, it is recommended that you call [**FilterReplyMessage**](/windows/win32/api/fltuser/nf-fltuser-filterreplymessage) and **FltSendMessage** (leveraging the above example) by setting **dwReplyBufferSize** and **ReplyLength** both to ```sizeof(FILTER_REPLY_HEADER) + sizeof(MY_STRUCT)``` instead of ```sizeof(REPLY_STRUCT)```. This ensures that any extra padding at the end of the REPLY_STRUCT structure is ignored.
