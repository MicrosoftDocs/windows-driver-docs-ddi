# UcmConnectorDataDirectionChanged function


## -description


Notifies the USB connector manager framework extension (UcmCx) with the new data role  of a change in data role.


## -syntax


````
NTSTATUS UcmConnectorDataDirectionChanged(
  [in] UCMCONNECTOR       Connector,
  [in] BOOLEAN            Success,
  [in] UCM_TYPEC_PARTNER  CurrentDataRole
);
````


## -parameters




### -param Connector [in]

Handle to the connector object that the client driver received in the previous call to <a href="..\ucmmanager\nf-ucmmanager-ucmconnectorcreate.md">UcmConnectorCreate</a>.


### -param Success [in]

Used to indicate failure of a data-role swap that was initiated by UcmCx using <a href="..\ucmmanager\nc-ucmmanager-evt_ucm_connector_set_data_role.md">EVT_UCM_CONNECTOR_SET_DATA_ROLE</a>. 

If TRUE, the operation was successful. FALSE, otherwise.


### -param CurrentDataRole [in]

A <a href="..\ucmtypes\ne-ucmtypes-_ucm_typec_partner.md">UCM_TYPEC_PARTNER</a> value that indicates the new data role. 


## -returns



<b>UcmConnectorDataDirectionChanged</b> returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, this method can return an appropriate <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/7792201b-63bb-4db5-803d-2af02893d505">NTSTATUS</a> value. 




## -remarks



If the connector partner is attached, UcmCx updates the data role of the partner depending on the <i>CurrentDataRole</i> value. For example, if the client driver changes the data role to <b>UcmTypeCPortStateUfp</b>, UcmCx updates the role of the connector partner to <b>UcmTypeCPortStateDfp</b>.

UcmCx can change the data role of a connector, and invokes <a href="..\ucmmanager\nc-ucmmanager-evt_ucm_connector_set_data_role.md">EVT_UCM_CONNECTOR_SET_DATA_ROLE</a>. In response to that call, the client should perform the DR_Swap operation, and indicate success/failure of the operation by calling  <b>UcmConnectorDataDirectionChanged</b>.

Alternatively, the client driver might choose to perform a role-swap autonomously, or the partner might perform a role-swap. In either case, when the role-swap has completed, the driver must report the new role to UcmCx using <b>UcmConnectorDataDirectionChanged</b>.
