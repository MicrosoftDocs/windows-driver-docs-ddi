## -description

A WiFiCx driver's *EvtWifiDeviceSendCommand* callback function retrieves and processes a command message sent by the WiFiCx framework.  

## -parameters

### -param Device

[_In_] A handle to a framework device object that the client driver obtained from a previous call to [**WdfDeviceCreate**](../wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate.md).

### -param SendRequest

[_In_] A handle to a framework WIFIREQUEST object that represents a command message. 

## -remarks

A WiFiCx client driver must register its *EvtWifiDeviceSendCommand* callback function by calling [**WiFiDeviceInitialize**](nf-wificx-wifideviceinitialize.md).

The WiFiCx framework invokes *EvtWifiDeviceSendCommand* to issue a command message to the client driver.

- To retrieve the message, the client driver calls [**WifiRequestGetInOutBuffer**](nf-wificx-wifirequestgetinoutbuffer.md) to get the input/output buffer and buffer lengths. The driver also needs to call [**WifiRequestGetMessageId**](nf-wificx-wifirequestgetmessageid.md) to retrieve the message ID.

- To complete the request, the driver sends the M3 for the command asynchronously by calling [**WifiRequestComplete**](nf-wificx-wifirequestcomplete.md). 

- If this command is a set command and the original request did not contain a large enough buffer, the client should call [**WifiRequestSetBytesNeeded**](./nf-wificx-wifirequestsetbytesneeded.md) to set the required buffer size and then fail the request with status BUFFER\_OVERFLOW.

- If this command is a task command, the client driver needs to later send the associated M4 indication by calling [**WifiDeviceReceiveIndication**](nf-wificx-wifidevicereceiveindication.md) and pass the indication buffer with a WDI header that contains the same message ID as contained in the M1.
