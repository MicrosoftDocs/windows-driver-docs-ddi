## -description

The **DXGKARGCB_OPEN_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_OBJECT** structure contains the information used by the [**DXGKCB_OPENPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_openphysicalmemoryobject.md) callback function to open a physical memory object.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPhysicalMemoryObject [in]

The physical memory object handle that was returned from a call to [**DXGKCB_CREATEPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_createphysicalmemoryobject.md).

### -field hAdapter [in]

A handle to any adapter that is part of the logical adapter to open the physical object against. This can be any physical adapter that is linked together in a linked display adapter (LDA) chain.

### -field hAdapterMemoryObject [out]

Field in which a handle to the opened physical memory object for this adapter is returned.

## -remarks

If the driver [creates a physical memory object](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_createphysicalmemoryobject.md) and specifies a non-NULL value for *hAdapter* in that call, then it must not call **DxgkCbOpenPhysicalObject** again. Doing so will return a failure indicating that the physical object is already opened against the adapter.

At this time, a physical memory object may only be opened by a single adapter. Attempting to open the object on a second adapter will fail.

Opening a physical memory object against one physical adapter is sufficient. This guarantees that all physical adapters in the logical adapter (all linked adapters) have a mirrored view of this memory.

See [IOMMU DMA remapping](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iommu-dma-remapping) for more information.
