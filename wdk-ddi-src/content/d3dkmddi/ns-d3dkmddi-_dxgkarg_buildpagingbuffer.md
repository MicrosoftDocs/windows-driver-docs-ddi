# DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER structure

## -description

The **DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER** structure describes parameters for the [DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer.md) callback that builds a paging buffer for use in a memory-transfer operation.

## -struct-fields

### -field pDmaBuffer [in/out]

A virtual address to the first available byte in the paging buffer. When the driver is first called with a new paging buffer, this virtual address is aligned on 4 KB. The driver tightly packs operations in the paging buffer until the paging buffer is full and then uses a new paging buffer. Therefore, if the graphics processing unit (GPU) requires a specific alignment for a paging-buffer submission, the driver should enforce this alignment by padding the operations that it writes to the paging buffer. Before the [**DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer.md) function returns, the driver should update **pDmaBuffer** to point past the last byte that is written to the paging buffer.

### -field DmaSize [in/out]

The size, in bytes, of the paging buffer that **pDmaBuffer** specifies.

### -field pDmaBufferPrivateData [in/out]

A pointer to a driver-resident private data structure that is associated with the direct memory access (DMA) buffer (that is, paging buffer) that **pDmaBuffer** specifies.

### -field DmaBufferPrivateDataSize [in/out]

The number of bytes that remain in the private data structure that **pDmaBufferPrivateData** points to for the current operation.

### -field Operation [in]

A [**DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_OPERATION**](ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_buildpagingbuffer_operation.md)-typed value that indicates the type of memory operation to perform.

### -field MultipassOffset [in/out]

A UINT value that specifies the progress of the paging operation if multiple paging buffers are required. The driver sets this value to indicate a split into multiple paging buffers for more than one transfer operation. For example, the driver can store the page number that was last transferred for a paged-based transfer.

### -field Transfer [in]

A structure that describes the transfer operation.

### -field Transfer.hAllocation [in]

A handle to the allocation that the driver's [**DxgkDdiCreateAllocation**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation.md) function previously returned in the **hAllocation** member of a [**DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo.md) structure, which is part of the [**DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createallocation.md) structure's **pAllocationInfo** member. The allocation handle points to a buffer that contains private driver data for the transfer.

### -field Transfer.TransferOffset [in]

The offset, in bytes, of the first page within the allocation that is transferred. This offset is applied only to a location that a segment location describes. This offset does not apply to an [**MDL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl.md) description of a memory range. If the driver requires more than one paging buffer to complete the transfer (that is, the driver returns STATUS_GRAPHICS_INSUFFICIENT_DMA_BUFFER from its [**DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer.md) function), **TransferOffset** is the same for each call to **DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer** for this transfer.

### -field Transfer.TransferSize [in]

The size, in bytes, of the memory information to transfer.

### -field Transfer.Source [in]

A structure that describes the source allocation. This structure contains a **SegmentId** member and a union that contains either an offset into a segment of the source allocation (**SegmentAddress**) or a pointer to an [**MDL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl.md) for the source (**pMdl**).

### -field Transfer.Source.SegmentId [in]

### -field Transfer.Source.SegmentAddress [in]

The source segment address, if the **SegmentId** member of **Source** is nonzero. The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem computes the segment address as the sum of the segment offset and the base address of the segment: ```SegmentAddress = SegmentOffset + Segment.BaseAddr```.

### -field Transfer.Source.pMdl [in]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the [**MDL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl.md) structure that describes the system memory pages for the source, if the **SegmentId** member of **Source** is zero.

### -field Transfer.Destination [in]

A structure that describes the destination allocation. This structure contains a **SegmentId** member and a union that contains either an offset into a segment of the destination allocation (**SegmentAddress**) or a pointer to an [**MDL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl.md) for the destination (**pMdl**).

### -field Transfer.Destination.SegmentId [in]

The identifier of a segment within the destination allocation, or zero if the destination allocation is described by the **pMdl** member of the union that **Destination** contains.

### -field Transfer.Destination.SegmentAddress [in]

The destination segment address, if the **SegmentId** member of **Destination** is nonzero. The DirectX graphics kernel subsystem computes the segment address as the sum of the segment offset and the base address of the segment: ```SegmentAddress = SegmentOffset + Segment.BaseAddr```.

The offset, in system memory pages, within the [**MDL**](../wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl.md) structure that the **pMdl** member points to, to the first system memory page for the current operation. The driver can obtain the physical address of the first system memory page by calling the [**MmGetMdlPfnArray**](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer#mmgetmdlpfnarray function as follows.

```cpp
MmGetMdlPfnArray(pMdl)[MdlOffset];
