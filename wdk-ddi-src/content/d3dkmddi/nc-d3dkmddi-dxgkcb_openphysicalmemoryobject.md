## -description

A kernel-mode display miniport driver calls **DXGKCB_OPENPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT** to open a physical memory object and associates it with an adapter.

## -parameters

### -param pArgs [in/out]

Pointer to a [**DXGKARGCB_OPEN_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_OBJECT**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkargcb_open_physical_memory_object.md) structure that contains information about the physical memory object to open.

## -returns

**DXGKCB_OPENPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, returns an appropriate NTSTATUS error code.

## -remarks

In order to create an address descriptor list (ADL) from a physical memory object, it must first be associated with an adapter. This is normally done when the physical memory object is created by specifying the **hAdapter** parameter in a call to [**DXGKCB_CREATEPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_createphysicalmemoryobject.md). However, in some cases, the adapter handle is not available at the time the memory was allocated (for example, early in the boot process). In this case, the driver must call **DXGKCB_OPENPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT** to associate the physical memory object with an adapter prior to calling [**DXGKCB_ALLOCATEADL**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_allocateadl.md).

See [IOMMU DMA remapping](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iommu-dma-remapping) for more information.

*DXGKCB_XXX* functions are implemented by *Dxgkrnl*. To use this callback function, set the appropriate members of [**DXGKARGCB_OPEN_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_OBJECT**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgkargcb_open_physical_memory_object.md) and then call **DxgkCbOpenPhysicalMemoryObject** via the [**DXGKRNL_INTERFACE**](../dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgkrnl_interface.md).
