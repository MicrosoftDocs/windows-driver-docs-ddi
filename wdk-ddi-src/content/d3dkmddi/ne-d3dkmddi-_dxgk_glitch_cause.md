# DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE enumeration

## -description

Enumeration that describes what caused a glitch during a [**SetTimingsFromVidPn**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_settimingsfromvidpn.md) call.

## -enum-fields

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_DRIVER_ERROR

Indicates that an internal driver error caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_TIMING_CHANGE

Indicates that the timing requested necessitated a glitch.  This cause should only be used if the OS requested a change which would always result in a glitch rather than something which could have been avoided under other circumstances.  

For example, this should not be used if the driver switches to a different display pipe to support an additional path, but it should be used if the OS requests a different timing to the previous one.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_PIPELINE_CHANGE

Indicates that reconfiguring the display pipeline caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_MEMORY_TIMING

Indicates that changing graphics memory timings caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_ENCODER_RECONFIG

Indicates that changing the configuration of the encoder for a target caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_MODIFIED_WIRE_USAGE

Indicates that modifying the format of pixel data in the transport stream caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_METADATA_CHANGE

Indicates that changing the frame metadata caused a glitch.

### -field DXGK_GLITCH_CAUSE_NONE

Indicates that there was no glitch.
