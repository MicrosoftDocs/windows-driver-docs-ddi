# DXGK_QUERYADAPTERINFOTYPE enumeration

## -description

The **DXGK_QUERYADAPTERINFOTYPE** enumeration indicates the type of information to retrieve when a display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) function is called.

## -enum-fields

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_UMDRIVERPRIVATE:0

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_NUMPOWERCOMPONENTS:6

The display miniport should provide a UINT value that specifies the number of power components that it uses. Supported starting in Windows 8.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_POWERCOMPONENTINFO:7

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_POWER_RUNTIME_COMPONENT**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_power_runtime_component.md) structure with information about the *n*th power component, where *n* is the component index specified by **[DXGKARG_QUERYADAPTERINFO](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_queryadapterinfo.md).pInputData** in a call to [DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_queryadapterinfo.md).

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_INTEGRATED_DISPLAY_DESCRIPTOR:17

Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1703. Indicates a request for an integrated panel descriptor where the input buffer to the query will be a [**DXGK_QUERYINTEGRATEDDISPLAYIN**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_qaitargetin.md) structure and the output buffer is a [**DXGK_QUERYINTEGRATEDDISPLAYOUT**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryintegrateddisplayout2.md) structure.

Although this function addresses a target, only DxgKrnl adapter locks are taken over this call, not child device locks. In practice, since this call will be made before the child device is exposed, there should be no concurrent DDI calls which address the same target.

NOTE: Unlike most QueryAdapterInfo calls, the output buffer size is variable although it is still known in advance from the DescriptorLength field of the [**DXGK_INTEGRATED_DISPLAY_CHILD**](../dispmprt/ns-dispmprt-_dxgk_integrated_display_child.md) structure for the target id. The size of the output buffer is:
```DescriptorLength + FIELD_OFFSET( DXGK_QUERYINTEGRATEDDISPLAYOUT, Descriptor )```.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_UEFIFRAMEBUFFERRANGES:18

Indicates request for the UEFI frame buffer ranges. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1703.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_QUERYCOLORIMETRYOVERRIDES:19

Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1703. Indicates a request for colorimetry overrides for an external display, where the input buffer to the query will be a [**DXGK_QUERYCOLORIMETRYOVERRIDESIN**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_qaitargetin.md) structure, containing only the target id being addressed and the output buffer is a [**DXGK_COLORIMETRY**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_colorimetry.md) structure into which the driver writes overrides for the monitor attached to the target.

Although this function addresses a target, only DxgKrnl adapter locks are taken over this call, not child device locks.  Since this call will be made before the child device is exposed, there should be no concurrent DDI calls which address the same target.

The output buffer is zeroed when passed to the driver.  If the driver has no overrides for the monitor, it should return STATUS_SUCCESS and leave the output buffer zeroed.  If the driver has overrides, it fill in all fields of the DXGK_COLORIMETRY to describe the monitor capabilities as the OS will not accept partial overrides.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_DISPLAYID_DESCRIPTOR:20

Indicates a request for an integrated panel descriptor where the input buffer to the query will be a [**DXGK_QAITARGETIN**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_qaitargetin.md) structure and the output buffer is a [**DXGK_QUERYINTEGRATEDDISPLAYOUT**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryintegrateddisplayout2.md) structure. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1709.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_FRAMEBUFFERSAVESIZE:21

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_FRAMEBUFFERSAVEAREA**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_framebuffersavearea.md) structure with the size of the frame buffer to save to system memory during power transitions. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_HARDWARERESERVEDRANGES:22

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_HARDWARERESERVEDRANGES**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_hardwarereservedranges.md) structure with its hardware reserved memory ranges. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_INTEGRATED_DISPLAY_DESCRIPTOR2:23

Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803. Indicates a request for an integrated panel descriptor where the input buffer to the query will be a [**DXGK_QAITARGETIN**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_qaitargetin.md) structure and the output buffer is a [**DXGK_QUERYINTEGRATEDDISPLAYOUT2**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_queryintegrateddisplayout2.md) structure. This query replaces use of the **DXGKQAITYPE_INTEGRATED_DISPLAY_DESCRIPTOR** query for WDDM 2.4 drivers.

[**TypeIntegratedDisplay** child devices](../dispmprt/ne-dispmprt-_dxgk_child_device_type.md) are reported by calling [**DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) with the *Type* set to this value.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_NODEPERFDATA:24

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_NODE_PERFDATA**](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_node_perfdata.md) structure that represents performance data collected per engine from an adapter on an interval basis. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_ADAPTERPERFDATA:25

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_ADAPTER_PERFDATA**](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_adapter_perfdata.md) structure that represents performance data collected per adapter on an interval basis. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_ADAPTERPERFDATA_CAPS:26

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_ADAPTER_PERFDATACAPS**](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_adapter_perfdatacaps.md) structure that represents data capabilities that are static and queried once per GPU during initialization. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_GPUVERSION:27

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_GPUVERSION**](../d3dkmdt/ns-d3dkmdt-_dxgk_gpuversion.md) structure used to collect the BIOS version and GPU architecture name once during GPU initialization. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1803.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_DEVICE_TYPE_CAPS:28

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_DEVICE_TYPE_CAPS**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_device_type_caps.md) structure that describes the type of capabilities for a device. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1809.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_WDDMDEVICECAPS:29

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_SCANOUT_CAPS:33

The display miniport driver should populate a DXGK_QUERY_SCANOUT_CAPS_OUT structure that describes the scanout capabilities of the driver. Supported starting in Windows 10, version 1903.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_CAPS:34

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_CAPS**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgk_physical_memory_caps.md) structure that describes the physical memory restrictions (the highest visible physical address) of the device. Supported starting in Windows Server 2022 (WDDM 2.9).

See **DXGKQAITYPE_IOMMU_CAPS** for details on how to indicate driver support for IOMMU linear remapping.

### -field DXGKQAITYPE_IOMMU_CAPS:35

The display miniport driver should populate a [**DXGK_IOMMU_CAPS**](ns-d3dkmddi-dxgk_iommu_caps.md) structure that indicates that IOMMU linear remapping is supported by the driver. Supported starting in Windows Server 2022 (WDDM 2.9). To indicate support for linear remapping, the driver must also inform *Dxgkernel* about its physical memory restrictions through the **DXGKQAITYPE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_CAPS** cap.

Logical remapping can only be done if no existing physical memory is referenced by the device, so *Dxgkrnl*'s call sequence is as follows:

* Call [**DxgkDdiAddDevice**](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_add_device.md) for all physical adapters, so that the driver can gather information for all linked physical adapters.

* Call [**DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) with DXGKQAITYPE_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_CAPS and DXGKQAITYPE_IOMMU_CAPS so that it can then create and attach the device to an IOMMU domain before any memory can be accessed.

* Call [**DxgkDdiStartDevice**](../dispmprt/nc-dispmprt-dxgkddi_start_device.md) to start the device.

## -remarks

*Dxgkrnl* calls the display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiQueryAdapterInfo**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_queryadapterinfo.md) callback to retrieve configuration information from the graphics adapter. The driver fills the requested information in the buffer pointed to by the **pOutputData** member of the [**DXGKARG_QUERYADAPTERINFO**](ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_queryadapterinfo.md) structure. See each enumeration value for the type of structure to fill in.
