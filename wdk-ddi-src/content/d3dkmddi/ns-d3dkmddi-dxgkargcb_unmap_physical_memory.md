## -description

The **DXGKARGCB_UNMAP_PHYSICAL_MEMORY** structure contains information about the physical memory object from which the CPU-visible address is being unmapped by the [**DXGKCB_UNMAPPHYSICALMEMORY**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_unmapphysicalmemory.md) callback function.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPhysicalMemoryObject

The physical memory object from which the CPU-visible address is being unmapped.

### -field pBaseAddress

The base address returned from [**DXGKCB_MAPPHYSICALMEMORY**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_mapphysicalmemory.md) that is being unmapped.

### -field Size

The size, in bytes, of the mapped region. This should match the mapped **Size** parameter that was output from the corresponding map call.

## -remarks

See [IOMMU DMA remapping](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iommu-dma-remapping) for more information.
