## -description

The **DXGKARGCB_DESTROY_PHYSICAL_MEMORY_OBJECT** structure contains the information used by the [**DXGKCB_DESTROYPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_destroyphysicalmemoryobject.md) callback function to destroy physical memory.

## -struct-fields

### -field hPhysicalMemoryObject [in]

Handle to the physical memory object created via [**DXGKCB_CREATEPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_createphysicalmemoryobject.md) to destroy.

### -field hAdapterMemoryObject [in]

Optional handle to an adapter memory object to close at the same time. This handle is provided for the purpose of creating a convenient mirror mapping with destroy. If **hAdapterMemoryObject** is not NULL, the driver must not also call [**DXGKCB_CLOSEPHYSICALMEMORYOBJECT**](nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkcb_closephysicalmemoryobject.md).

## -remarks

If the driver attempts to destroy a physical object that still has an existing ADL created against it, the call will bugcheck the machine since the driver is leaking locked pages.

See [IOMMU DMA remapping](/windows-hardware/drivers/display/iommu-dma-remapping) for more information.
