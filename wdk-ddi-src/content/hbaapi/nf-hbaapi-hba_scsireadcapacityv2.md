# HBA_ScsiReadCapacityV2 function


## -description


The <b>HBA_ScsiReadCapacityV2</b> routine sends a SCSI read capacity command to the indicated remote port. 


## -syntax


````
HBA_STATUS HBA_API HBA_ScsiReadCapacityV2(
  _In_    HBA_HANDLE HbaHandle,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    HbaPortWWN,
  _In_    HBA_WWN    discoveredPortWWN,
  _In_    HBA_UINT64 fcLUN,
  _Out_   void       *pRespBuffer,

  _Inout_ HBA_UINT32 *pSenseBufferSize
);
````


## -parameters




### -param HbaHandle [in]

Contains a value returned by the routine <a href="..\hbaapi\nf-hbaapi-hba_openadapter.md">HBA_OpenAdapter</a> that identifies the HBA through which the SCSI read capacity command is sent.


### -param HbaPortWWN [in]

Contains a 64-bit worldwide name (WWN) that uniquely identifies the local HBA port from which the SCSI inquiry command is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


### -param DiscoveredPortWWN

TBD


### -param FcLUN

TBD


### -param pRespBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the output data of the SCSI read capacity command.


### -param pRespBufferSize [in, out]

Indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pRespBuffer</i>.


### -param pScsiStatus [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the SCSI status data. 


### -param pSenseBuffer [out]

Pointer to a buffer that receives the SCSI sense data.


### -param pSenseBufferSize [in, out]

On input, indicates the size, in bytes, of the buffer at <i>pSenseBuffer</i>. On output, this member indicates the number of bytes of sense data returned.


#### - discoveredPortWWN [in]

Contains a 64-bit WWN that uniquely identifies the remote HBA port to which the SCSI read capacity command is sent. For a discussion of worldwide names, see the T11 committee's <i>Fibre Channel HBA API</i> specification. 


#### - fcLUN [in]

Indicates the fibre channel logical unit number of the logical unit to which the SCSI read capacity command will be sent. 


## -returns



The <b>HBA_ScsiReadCapacityV2</b> routine returns a value of type <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff557233">HBA_STATUS</a> that indicates the status of the HBA. In particular, <b>HBA_ScsiReadCapacityV2</b> returns one of the following values.
