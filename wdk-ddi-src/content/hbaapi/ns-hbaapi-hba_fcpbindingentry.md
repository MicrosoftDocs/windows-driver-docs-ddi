## -description


The HBA_FCPBindingEntry structure is equivalent to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556034">HBAFCPBindingEntry</a>. The WMI tool suite generates the HBAFCPBindingEntry when it compiles the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff556037">HBAFCPBindingEntry WMI Class</a>.  HBA_FCPBindingEntry is used with the fibre channel HBA API library and is declared in <i>hbaapi.h</i>.
