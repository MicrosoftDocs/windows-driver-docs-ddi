# NDK_FN_RELEASE_LAM callback


## -description


The <i>NdkReleaseLam</i> (<i>NDK_FN_RELEASE_LAM</i>) function releases an NDK adapter logical address mapping (LAM).


## -parameters




### -param *pNdkAdapter [in]

A pointer to an NDK adapter object
(<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439848">NDK_ADAPTER</a>).


### -param *pNdkLAM [in]

A pointer to an <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439920">NDK_LOGICAL_ADDRESS_MAPPING</a> structure that was previously initialized by calling the <i>NdkBuildLAM</i>  (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439860">NDK_FN_BUILD_LAM</a>) function.



## -returns



None




## -remarks



<i>NdkReleaseLam</i> releases an adapter logical address mapping (LAM). The associated MDL  remains unchanged. That is, the MDL is in the same state it hand when it was  passed to the <i>NdkBuildLam</i> (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/hh439860">NDK_FN_BUILD_LAM</a>) function. The NDK consumer must not release a LAM until after all of the work requests that use the LAM are completed.
