# NDK_FN_FLUSH callback


## -description


The <i>NdkFlush</i> (<i>NDK_FN_FLUSH</i>) function initiates cancelling of the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on an NDK queue pair (QP) object.


## -prototype


````
NDK_FN_FLUSH NdkFlush;

VOID NdkFlush(
  _In_ NDK_QP *pNdkQp
)
{ ... }
````


## -parameters




#### - *pNdkQp [in]

A pointer to an NDK queue pair (QP) object (<a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_qp.md">NDK_QP</a>).


#### - pNdkQp [in]

A pointer to an NDK queue pair (QP) object (<a href="..\ndkpi\ns-ndkpi-_ndk_qp.md">NDK_QP</a>).


## -returns


None



## -remarks


<i>NdkFlush</i> cancels the receive and the initiator queue requests that are currently pending on a QP. The flushed requests have STATUS_CANCELLED as completion status.

If the  NDK consumer wants to verify that all of the requests are flushed after issuing <i>NdkFlush</i>, the consumer must empty the CQ until it sees completions for all requests that were queued prior to calling <i>NdkFlush</i>.
