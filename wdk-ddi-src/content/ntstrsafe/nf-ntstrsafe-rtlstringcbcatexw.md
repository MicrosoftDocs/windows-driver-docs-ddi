# RtlStringCbCatExW function

## -description

The **RtlStringCbCatExW** and **RtlStringCbCatExA** functions concatenate two byte-counted strings.

## -parameters

### -param pszDest [in, out, optional]

A pointer to a buffer which, on input, contains a null-terminated string to which *pszSrc* will be concatenated. On output, this is the destination buffer that contains the entire resultant string. The string at *pszSrc* is added to the end of the string at *pszDest* and terminated with a null character. The *pszDest* pointer can be **NULL**, but only if STRSAFE_IGNORE_NULLS is set in *dwFlags*.

### -param cbDest [in]

The size of the destination buffer, in bytes. The buffer must be large enough to include both strings and the terminating null character.

For Unicode strings, the maximum number of bytes is `NTSTRSAFE_MAX_CCH * sizeof(WCHAR)`

For ANSI strings, the maximum number of bytes is `NTSTRSAFE_MAX_CCH * sizeof(char)`

### -param pszSrc [in, optional]

A pointer to a null-terminated string. This string will be concatenated to the end of the string that is contained in the buffer at *pszDest*. The *pszSrc* pointer can be **NULL**, but only if STRSAFE_IGNORE_NULLS is set in *dwFlags*.

### -param ppszDestEnd [out, optional]

If the caller supplies a non-**NULL** address pointer, then after the concatenation operation completes, the function loads that address with a pointer to the destination buffer's resulting **NULL** string terminator.

### -param pcbRemaining [out, optional]

If the caller supplies a non-**NULL** address pointer, the function loads the address with the number of unused bytes that are in the buffer pointed to by *pszDest*, including bytes used for the terminating null character.

### -param dwFlags [in]

One or more flags and, optionally, a fill byte. The flags are defined as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STRSAFE_FILL_BEHIND_NULL</b></td>
    <td>
      If this flag is set and the function succeeds, the low byte of <i>dwFlags</i> is used to fill the portion of the destination
      buffer that follows the terminating null character.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STRSAFE_IGNORE_NULLS</b></td>
    <td>
      If this flag is set, either <i>pszDest</i> or <i>pszSrc</i>, or both, can be <b>NULL</b>. <b>NULL</b> <i>pszSrc</i> pointers
      are treated like empty strings (TEXT("")), which can be copied. <b>NULL</b> <i>pszDest</i> pointers cannot receive
      nonempty strings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STRSAFE_FILL_ON_FAILURE</b></td>
    <td>
      If this flag is set and the function fails, the low byte of <i>dwFlags</i> is used to fill the entire destination buffer, and
      the buffer is null-terminated. This operation overwrites any preexisting buffer contents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STRSAFE_NULL_ON_FAILURE</b></td>
    <td>
      If this flag is set and the function fails, the destination buffer is set to an empty string (TEXT("")). This operation
      overwrites any preexisting buffer contents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STRSAFE_NO_TRUNCATION</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>If this flag is set and the function returns <b>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If <b>STRSAFE_FILL_ON_FAILURE</b> is also specified, <b>STRSAFE_NO_TRUNCATION</b> fills the destination buffer
          accordingly.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, the destination buffer will be unmodified.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## -returns

The function returns one of the NTSTATUS values that are listed in the following table. For information about how to test NTSTATUS values, see [Using NTSTATUS Values](/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Return code</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STATUS_SUCCESS</b></td>
    <td>
      This <i>success</i> status means source data was present, the strings were fully concatenated without truncation,
      and the resultant destination buffer is null-terminated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</b></td>
    <td>
      This <i>warning</i> status means the copy operation did not complete due to insufficient space in the destination
      buffer. If <b>STRSAFE_NO_TRUNCATION</b> is set, see the <i>dwFlags</i> parameter for more information.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>This <i>error</i> status means the function received an invalid input parameter. For more information, see the
        following paragraph.</p>
      <p>The function returns the <b>STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</b> when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An invalid flag was specified.</li>
        <li>The value in cbDest is larger than the maximum buffer size.</li>
        <li>The destination buffer was already full.</li>
        <li>A <b>NULL</b> pointer was present without the <b>STRSAFE_IGNORE_NULLS</b> flag.</li>
        <li>The destination buffer pointer was <b>NULL</b>, but the buffer size was not zero.</li>
        <li>The destination buffer pointer was <b>NULL</b>, or its length was zero, but a nonzero length source string
          was present.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## -remarks

**RtlStringCbCatExW** and **RtlStringCbCatExA** should be used instead of the following functions.

- **strcat**
- **wcscat**

Because **RtlStringCbCatExW** and **RtlStringCbCatExA**receive the size of the destination buffer as input, they will not write past the end of the buffer.

**RtlStringCbCatEx** adds to the functionality of [RtlStringCbCat](./nf-ntstrsafe-rtlstringcbcata.md) by returning a pointer to the end of the destination string, as well as the number of bytes left unused in that string. Flags can also be passed to the function for additional control.

Use **RtlStringCbCatExW** to handle Unicode strings and **RtlStringCbCatExA** to handle ANSI strings. The form to use is determined by your data, as shown in the following table.

| String data type | String literal | Function |
|--|--|--|
| **WCHAR** | L"string" | **RtlStringCbCatExW** |
| **char** | "string" | **RtlStringCbCatExA** |

If *pszSrc* and *pszDest* point to overlapping strings, the behavior of the function is undefined.

Neither *pszSrc* nor *pszDest* can be **NULL** unless the STRSAFE_IGNORE_NULLS flag is set, in which case either or both can be **NULL**. If *pszDest* is **NULL**, *pszSrc* must either be **NULL** or point to an empty string.
