### -param ProcessId [out]


Receives the process ID of the process in which the event occurred.  If this information is not available, DEBUG_ANY_ID will be returned instead.

Receives the thread ID of the thread in which the last event occurred.  If this information is not available, DEBUG_ANY_ID will be returned instead.

### -param ExtraInformation [out, optional]

For example, if <i>Type</i> is breakpoint, <i>ExtraInformation</i> contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_BREAKPOINT; if Type is Exception, ExtraInformation contains a DEBUG_LAST_EVENT_INFO_EXCEPTION. Refer to <a href="/previous-versions/ff541478(v=vs.85)">DEBUG_EVENT_XXX</a> for the complete list of event types and the dbgeng.h header file for the structure definitions for each event type. 

  If <i>ExtraInformation</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

### -param ExtraInformationSize [in]


Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>ExtraInformation</i> specifies.

### -param ExtraInformationUsed [out, optional]


Receives the size, in bytes, of extra information.  If <i>ExtraInformationUsed</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

### -param Description [out, optional]


Receives the description of the event.  If <i>Description</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

### -param DescriptionSize [in]
