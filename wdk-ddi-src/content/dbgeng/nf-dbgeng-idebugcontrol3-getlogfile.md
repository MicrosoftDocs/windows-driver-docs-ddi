# IDebugControl3::GetLogFile method



## -description
The <b>GetLogFile</b>  method returns the name of the currently open log file.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetLogFile(
  [out, optional] PSTR   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG  BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG FileSize,
  [out]           PBOOL  Append
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [out, optional]

Receives the name of the currently open log file.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the size, in characters, of the <i>Buffer</i> buffer.


### -param FileSize [out, optional]

Receives the size, in characters, of the name of the log file.  If <i>FileSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param Append [out]

Receives <b>TRUE</b> if log messages are appended to the log file, or <b>FALSE</b> if the contents of the log file were discarded when the file was opened.


## -returns
This method can also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.  However, the name of the log file was too long to fit in the <i>Buffer</i> buffer so the name was truncated.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOINTERFACE</b></dt>
</dl>There is no currently open log file.

 


## -remarks
<b>GetLogFile</b> and <b>GetLogFileWide</b> behave the same way as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547025">GetLogFile2</a> and <b>GetLogFile2Wide</b> with <i>Append</i> receiving only the information about the DEBUG_LOG_APPEND flag.

For more information about log files, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560116">Using Input and Output</a>.
