### -param ExtraInformationSize [in]

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer that <i>ExtraInformation</i> specifies.


### -param ExtraInformationUsed [out, optional]

Receives the size, in bytes, of extra information.  If <i>ExtraInformationUsed</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param Description [out, optional]

Receives the description of the event.  If <i>Description</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param DescriptionSize [in]

Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer that <i>Description</i> specifies.
