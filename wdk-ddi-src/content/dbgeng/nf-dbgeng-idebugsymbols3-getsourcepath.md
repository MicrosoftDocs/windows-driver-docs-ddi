## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetSourcePath(
  [out, optional] PSTR   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG  BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG PathSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [out, optional]

Receives the source path.  This is a string that contains source path elements separated by semicolons (<b>;</b>).  Each source path element can specify either a directory or a source server.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

### -param PathSize [out, optional]

Receives the size, in characters, of the source path.

<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful. However, the buffer was not large enough to hold the source path and the path was truncated.

 


## -remarks
The source path is used by the engine when searching for source files.

For more information about manipulating the source path, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff560141">Using Source Files</a>.
