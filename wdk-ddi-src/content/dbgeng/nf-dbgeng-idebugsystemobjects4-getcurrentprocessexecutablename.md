## -description
The <b>GetCurrentProcessExecutableName</b>  method returns the name of executable file loaded in the current process.



## -syntax

````
HRESULT GetCurrentProcessExecutableName(
  [out, optional] PSTR   Buffer,
  [in]            ULONG  BufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG ExeSize
);
````


## -parameters

### -param Buffer [out, optional]

Receives the name of the executable file.  If <i>Buffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


### -param BufferSize [in]

Specifies the size in characters of the buffer <i>Buffer</i>.


### -param ExeSize [out, optional]

Receives the size in characters of the name of the executable file.  If <i>ExeSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## -returns
This method may also return error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful. However, the buffer was not large enough to hold the name of the executable file and it was truncated.

 


## -remarks
These methods are only available in user-mode debugging.

If the engine cannot determine the name of the executable file, it writes the string "?NoImage?" to the buffer.
