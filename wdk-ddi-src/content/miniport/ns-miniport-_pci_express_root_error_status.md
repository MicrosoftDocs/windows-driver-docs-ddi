## -description

The **PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS** structure describes a PCI Express (PCIe) root error status register of a PCIe advanced error reporting capability structure.

## -struct-fields

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME

The **DUMMYSTRUCTNAME** structure.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that a correctable error message has been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MultipleCorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple correctable error messages have been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.UncorrectableErrorReceived

A single bit that indicates that an uncorrectable error message has been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MultipleUncorrectableErrorsReceived

A single bit that indicates that multiple uncorrectable error messages have been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.FirstUncorrectableFatal

A single bit that indicates that the first uncorrectable error message that was received was for a fatal error.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.NonFatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.FatalErrorMessagesReceived

A single bit that indicates that one or more non-fatal uncorrectable error messages have been received.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Reserved

Reserved.

### -field DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.AdvancedErrorInterruptMessageNumber

The MSI/MSI-X vector that is used for the interrupt messages that are generated in association with any of the status bits of the advanced error reporting capability.

### -field AsULONG

A **ULONG** representation of the contents of the **PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS** structure.

## -remarks

The **PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS** union is available in Windows Server 2008 and later versions of Windows.

A **PCI_EXPRESS_ROOT_ERROR_STATUS** union is contained in the [PCI_EXPRESS_ROOTPORT_AER_CAPABILITY](../wdm/ns-wdm-_pci_express_rootport_aer_capability.md) structure.
