## -syntax

``` cpp
typedef struct _VIDEO_PORT_DEBUG_REPORT_INTERFACE

    IN USHORT                  Size;
    IN USHORT                  Version;

```

## -remarks

The video miniport driver supplies the **Size** and **Version** members of this structure, and then calls [**VideoPortQueryServices**](nf-video-videoportqueryservices.md), which initializes its remaining members.

If your video miniport driver detects a failure and then recovers from it, you can create an error report that can later be used for debugging by calling the callback function members of **VIDEO_PORT_DEBUG_REPORT_INTERFACE** as follows:

1. First, call **DbgReportCreate** to create an initial report.
2. Then add data to the report by making one or more calls to **DbgReportSecondaryData**.
3. When you have finished adding data to the report, call **DbgReportComplete**.

The error report is saved in a file and scheduled to be sent to Microsoft when the computer is rebooted. The error report contains an error code and four arguments. The error code and the first three arguments are provided by the caller of **DbgReportCreate**. The fourth argument in the report is provided by the operating system and indicates the number of reports generated since the computer was started. For example, if the value of **ulpArg4** is 5, this means that four previous error reports were generated by the display miniport driver since the computer was last started. Only the fifth report is saved because each report overwrites the previous one.

The **VIDEO_DEBUG_REPORT** structure returned by **DbgReportCreate** and subsequently passed to **DbgReportSecondaryData** and **DbgReportComplete** is opaque. Do not attempt to access its members directly.

The following sections describe these callback functions in detail. These callbacks must be called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL.

### DbgReportCreate

**DbgReportCreate** creates an initial error report. It creates an entry in the system event log and displays a dialog box that informs the user of the failure and presents the opportunity to upload an error report to Microsoft. **DbgReportCreate** returns a pointer to an opaque **VIDEO_DEBUG_REPORT** structure that represents a handle to the newly created debug report.

#### DbgReportCreate Parameters

* **HwDeviceHandle [in]**
A handle to a context block associated with a display adapter. The display miniport driver created this handle in its DxgkDdiAddDevice function. This parameter can be NULL.
* **ulCode [in]** A code for the error report. The following codes are supported: THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER VIDEO_DRIVER_DEBUG_REPORT_REQUEST, VIDEO_TDR_FATAL_ERROR, and  VIDEO_TDR_SUCCESS.
* **ulpArg1 [in]** The first argument to be added to the report. The developer of the display miniport driver determines the value and meaning of **ulpArg1**.
* **ulpArg2 [in]** The second argument to be added to the report. The developer of the display miniport driver determines the value and meaning of **ulpArg2**.
* **ulpArg3 [in]** The third argument to be added to the report. The developer of the display miniport driver determines the value and meaning of **ulpArg3**.
* **ulpArg4 [in]** Reserved for system use.

### DbgReportSecondaryData

The DbgReportSecondaryData function appends data to an initial error report that was previously created by **DbgReportCreate**. If **DbgReportSecondaryData** succeeds, it returns **TRUE**. Otherwise, it returns **FALSE**.

Call **DbgReportSecondaryData** to add data to an initial report that was created by a previous call to **DbgReportCreate**. You can call **DbgReportSecondaryData** several times, but with each call, the data written to the report overwrites the data written by the previous call. The following steps give a good strategy for incrementally adding data to the report.

1. Obtain the data that is safest to collect.
2. Call **DbgReportSecondaryData** to write that data to the report.
3. Obtain data that is more risky to collect.
4. Call **DbgReportSecondaryData** to write the original safe data along with the newly collected risky data to the report. You must include both the safe and the risky data in this call because the data written by this call overwrites the data written by the first call to **DbgReportSecondaryData**.
5. Continue calling **DbgReportSecondaryData**, enhancing the data each time, until you have no more data to add.

When you have finished adding data to the report, close the report by calling **DbgReportComplete**. If the computer stops responding before you call **DbgReportComplete**, the data added to the report by the most recent successful call to **DbgReportSecondaryData** is saved and then sent to Microsoft when the computer is rebooted.

#### DbgReportSecondaryData Parameters

* **hReport [in, out]** A handle to the error report to which data will be appended. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle by calling DbgReportCreate.
* **pvData [in]** A pointer to a buffer that holds the data to be added to the report.
* **ulDataSize [in]** The size, in bytes, of the data to be added to the report. The value of this parameter must be less than or equal to DXGK_DEBUG_REPORT_MAX_SIZE.

### DbgReportComplete

The **DbgReportComplete** function closes an error report and frees any resources associated with the report.

**DbgReportComplete** creates an entry in the system event log and displays a dialog box that informs the user of the failure and the opportunity to upload an error report to Microsoft.

#### DbgReportComplete Parameters

* **hReport** A pointer to a **VIDEO_DEBUG_REPORT** structure that contains a handle to the error report that is to be closed. The display miniport driver previously obtained this handle by calling **DbgReportCreate**.
