# PFND3DDDI_PRESENT callback function

## -description

The <i>Present</i> function notifies the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and requests that the driver display the source surface by either copying or flipping or that the driver perform a color-fill operation.

## -parameters

### -param hDevice

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### -param Arg2

*pData* [in]

A pointer to a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure that describes the resource to display.

## -returns

<i>Present</i> returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The resource is successfully displayed.|
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Present could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.|

## -remarks

The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function to notify the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and to request that the driver display out the source surface or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. If the <b>hSrcResource</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure that the <i>pData</i> parameter points to is non-<b>NULL</b>, <i>Present</i> requests that the user-mode display driver display new content to the screen; if <b>hSrcResource</b> is <b>NULL</b>, <i>Present</i> requests that the user-mode display driver perform a color-fill operation to the screen. 

If the <b>hDstResource</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure is <b>NULL</b>, the destination surface is unknown. In addition, the destination surface and a list of clipping rectangles are determined in kernel mode before sending the hardware command stream through DMA to the graphics processor. 

As a result, the user-mode display driver cannot generate hardware instructions to perform the present operation. These hardware instructions must be generated by the display miniport driver. However, when the <b>hSrcResource</b> member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-<b>NULL</b>, the user-mode display driver must derive the allocation handle to the source surface and insert this handle in the <b>hSrcAllocation</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_present">D3DDDICB_PRESENT</a> structure in a call to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_presentcb">pfnPresentCb</a> function. The display miniport driver can then successfully generate the hardware instructions. The user-mode display driver typically derives the allocation handle from the resource information in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present">D3DDDIARG_PRESENT</a> structure.

If the <b>hDstResource</b> member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-<b>NULL</b>, the destination surface for the present is known and the user-mode display driver must fill in the <b>hDstAllocation</b> member of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_present">D3DDDICB_PRESENT</a> with the corresponding allocation handle.

If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of less than 0x0000000C (the driver returns this value in the <b>DriverVersion</b> member of the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_openadapter">D3D10DDIARG_OPENADAPTER</a> structure in a call to the driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_openadapter">OpenAdapter</a> function), the Direct3D runtime first calls the user-mode display driver's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfworkitem-flush">Flush</a> function to submit any outstanding hardware commands in the command buffer before the runtime calls the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function. In this way, the user-mode display driver's <i>Present</i> function is serialized with render operations (that is, calls to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb">pfnRenderCb</a> function). If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in windowed mode, the runtime also calls <i>Flush</i> before it calls <i>Present</i>. If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in full-screen mode, the runtime will not call <i>Flush</i> before it calls <i>Present</i>. This behavior allows drivers that implement their own threading to queue present calls. A driver that exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater must call <b>pfnRenderCb</b> to internally flush any outstanding command buffers before the driver calls the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_presentcb">pfnPresentCb</a> function.
