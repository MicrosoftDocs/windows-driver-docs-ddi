## -struct-fields




### -field FenceValue

[in] A 64-bit value that specifies the current fence value of the GPU synchronization object. This value applies only if the GPU synchronization object is of type <b>D3DDDI_FENCE</b>.


### -field CpuEventHandle

[in] The handle of an event object that will be signaled when the signal command is processed. This member must be set only when <b>Flags.EnqueueCpuEvent</b> is specified.


### -field MonitoredFenceValueArray

[in] An array of 64-bit monitored fence values to signal, each of which correspond to a synchronization object in <b>ObjectHandleArray</b>.


### -field Reserved

This member is reserved and should be set to zero.


### -field ObjectCount

[in] The number of synchronization events in the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> array and fence values in <b>MonitoredFenceValueArray</b> arrays.


### -field ObjectHandleArray

[in] An array of kernel-mode handles to the synchronization events that the context that is specified by the <b>hContext</b> member waits for.


### -field Flags

[in] A <a href="..\d3dukmdt\ns-d3dukmdt-_d3dddicb_signalflags.md">D3DDDICB_SIGNALFLAGS</a> structure that indicates, in bit-field flags, signaling behavior.


### -field BroadcastContextCount

[in] The number of contexts this signal operation will be broadcast to.


### -field BroadcastContextArray

[in] An array of kernel-mode handles to the context streams in which a signal for the synchronization events in the array that the <b>ObjectHandleArray</b> member specifies is inserted. The synchronization events are considered signaled only when all broadcast contexts reach the signal insertion point.
