# RtlIsRoot macro


## -description


The <b>RtlIsRoot</b> routine determines whether the specified node is the root node of a splay link tree. 


## -syntax


````
BOOLEAN RtlIsRoot(
  _In_ PRTL_SPLAY_LINKS Links
);
````


## -parameters




### -param Links [in]

Pointer to the node. The node must have been initialized by calling <b>RtlInitializeSplayLinks</b>. 


## -remarks



Callers of the <b>Rtl</b> splay link routines are responsible for synchronizing access to the splay link tree. A fast mutex is the most efficient synchronization mechanism to use for this purpose. 

Callers of <b>RtlIsRoot</b> must be running at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH_LEVEL if the splay link tree or just-initialized node at <i>Links</i> is nonpaged. Usually, callers are running at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL.
